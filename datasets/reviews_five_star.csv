5.0,"So disapointed! I have been buying these eco smart pants for several years... ..Who cuts & sews these things?The waist has no stretch in the last 3 pair and are HUGE!The inconsistencies make me crazy!Might just go to Walmart and buy cheap sweatpants, at least I'll know what I'm buying.Oh and the price went up as the quality went down.... way to go Hanes."
5.0,"Very comfy-would definitely purchase again in another color! this was actually an exchange cuz the other ones were wayy too Big on me so this was the other style to choose from, but same brand. I just wanted a comfy pair of sweatpants/joggers and these are definitely one of my favs. The one thing I would want on them is pockets tho, they don‚Äôt have pockets at all and they‚Äôre more of a boot cut sweat pant so u can wear them out and about and won‚Äôt look baggy or scrubby lol! I picked out  gray color and  It‚Äôs a light gray color. Very flattering on the body and don‚Äôt shrink when laundering. Would definitely recommend and purchase another pair"
5.0,"Great value I really like these‚Ä¶They are not too baggy being tall I would like a couple more inches.  I purchased black and navy.  The navy was more heather med navy, not my favorite, but fine for around the house.  Well made with nice wide waist band."
5.0,"Love These pants! I love these pants so much that I bought every single color for me and my daughters. I will definitely buy these again. They are so comfortable! They are a little large as expected, so I actually had to go a size down."
5.0,"Great value-runs very large These are an amazing value; comfy, warm and stretchy. Caution- they run very large. At 5‚Äô7‚Äù and 160 lbs., I usually order large. I like them roomy. When I first tried on the large, they literally fell to the floor. They have no drawstring, so tightening the waist isn‚Äôt an option. The medium fits as you would expect the large‚Äîroomy, but not too much. I love them. !"
5.0,"Don‚Äôt size up I ordered a xl thinking they would be roomy as I like to wear them around the house and want to be comfortable  but they run big.I should have ordered a sz L and they would have fit good with a little wiggle room.I have washed and dried and they did shrink a little, I think a few more wash and dry  and they will fit the way I like.They are soft and stretchy and would order again."
5.0,Great sweat pants. Received as described. Item was received as described in New condition. I wish they had pockets. I will research to see if they are available. Otherwise happy with purchase.
5.0,"Nice! Great basic sweatpants. Wish they had pockets, but I can't complain for the cost. I own these in every color and am pleased."
5.0,Loved it so much I bought another pair. Definitely worth the price. I like that the wide leg makes it not so sweatsuit looking. It‚Äôs my go to for cozy & comfort. I would Definitely recommend you buy the matching sweat shirt.  Size down - fits a bit large.
5.0,"Sweatpants Very warm. Moving to colder climate, need warm clothes"
5.0,"Soft and very comfortable Was searching for comfy sweat pants, so I decided to give these a try. I'm glad I did!"
5.0,"So soft. Of course all sweats are super soft when worn for the first time, so that's a given.  These were purchased because I lost a pair of sweatpants somewhere.  Purchased a size large, but unless these shrink I thing a medium would have been fine."
5.0,"Nice simple sweat pants Pluses and minuses in these pants depending what you want to do with them.I bought a medium. I'm 5'7' tall and weight approx. 160.  Normally I would wear between a medium and a large depending on mfg., material, etc. so I winged this purchase.  I actually made a lucky mistake in buying the 'petite' which was not labeled in the purchase description or a choice at check out!  BUT that wound up being okay since I have a short rise from crotch to waistline so not big extra bunches of extra material to have to turn down at the waist or worse yet alter.Good points.....nice material, washes well, feels good inside.  Nice cut to the pattern.  Tighter through the thighs growing a little bigger from the knees down to ankle and plenty wide enough through the calf/s (of course that would depend on your own personal calves).Bad points ....material shrinks maybe a 1/4-1/2"" inches,  so be prepared because pants will feel tighter after first putting them on BUT they will stretch somewhat as you wear them..  WAIST band is soft and loose - not snug but comfortable.!  NO SIDE SEAMS so if you needed or wanted to take them in you'd have to fuss to get the seam in the right place.  One piece construction with only a cuff/crotch/cuff seam.  Makes for a nice smooth side without a seam but almost impossible to let out UNLESS you make an insertion to alter if you need a bigger size or even taking them in.  Cheap fast finish at the cuff but easy enough to rip out with a razor blade and make shorter if you needed to.  Overall a quick factory made product with no frills and potential problems depending on how your body is built.  If you decide to keep just make sure you have at least 1/2"" to spare through the thighs!I will buy again but I'm considering going up a size because of the shrinkage making them a bit on the snug side through the thighs/hip area AFTER WASHING - I do not have big thighs either.  I just pray the waistband is not too loose in the larger size.  I might have to alter that if necessary but over all happy with the pants and way easier and cheaper than going out and buying the fabric and going through the hassle to make them which I could do but I don't want to be bothered!"
5.0,A good product I bought two pair and am very pleased with them. I only wish that they had pockets. The pants are a good product at an affordable price.
5.0,Comfy Perfect for traveling! Nice fit
5.0,"Like these sweatpants but sizing is inconsistent between colors. The Demin/blue colored XL were more like a XXXL, and the gray was short legged while the black sweats were fine."
5.0,"True to size True to size. Didn't shrink when washed, which is great. Very comfortable."
5.0,Buy Smaller Size These sweat pants are nice but run extremely large. I usually wear a Large so I bought a Medium and they are still way too large.
5.0,"A very good purchase Although there was a problem with delivery, the sweatpants themselves are very nice.  They are soft, lovely colors, wash well and fit nicely. I would buy them again."
5.0,Comfy And tts
5.0,Great buy Perfect fit and weight.
5.0,"You can wear them with anything...nice, straight leg I like them...the wind doesn't penetrate the fabric."
5.0,great fit and comfort great choice for comfort and activities
5.0,"Hanes brand Super comfy and soft on the inside not too tight around the waist, I bought the same thing earlier this month and accidentally order it too big so I‚Äôll be returning that pair but totally going to be buying more!"
5.0,These ain‚Äôt the cutest- but they comfy! üòä I am tired of leggings and tight pjs. I wanted cozy‚Äî and these are it!!! Super soft inside and great material on outside.I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5‚Äù 172 lbs and the large are just a tad big in the waist and slightly drag the floor without slippers or shoes on.These have quickly become my faves. I‚Äôm on the hunt for another color now!
5.0,It keeps on falling down on  me The pants are nice but keep on falling down onme
5.0,"Fleece-lined light weight sweat pants are great for year 'round comfort I bought these pants to wear both in and out of the house. Great for runs to the store without having to change pants. These will work for me in any weather!! They are very soft,  non-binding waistband and open bottoms make them EZ on & off!!  I just wish they had at least 1 pocket!! Great value for the price."
5.0,"No Draw String Somehow I missed this in the description, but not hating that my husband‚Äôs pants keep falling down and I can view the goods. ;P"
5.0,SLAY i love the fit and the color. i worn it once already and they‚Äôre SO comfy and also got a ton of compliments
5.0,Very comfy- they run big! I'm a size 12 and ordered a large- these run slightly big. I had a lot of space in the waist.
5.0,I love mine Very flattering.  Good length.  I wear mine daily as I ordered a couple more pairs.  Open ended bottom makes them dressier than regular sweat pants.  I love them as they wash like a dream and don't shrink in the dryer.
5.0,Comodidad Lo uso de diario en casa y me siento muy c√≥moda y con el fr√≠o muy calientita de mis piernas. Solo tuve wye subir un pico la bastilla porque para mi esta muy largo.
5.0,Very nice I like
5.0,"My favorite Great lightweight-but-warm sweats.  I have them in black and I wear them all though the winter.  They are my go to for at home but I would not be embarrassed to be seen in them out in public.  The waistband might be rather large but can be easily taken in.  They run very large.  I am a XL in almost all clothing but in these I take a M.  Go figure!!!  They wear very well (good combination of cotton and recycled plastic).  I have a pair that I am still wearing from 3 years ago and I just ordered another.  Comparing the old with the new, my old pair's black color is just slightly paler."
5.0,Pants are nice looking and very comfortable. Great fit and xomfortable
5.0,Great value Great value. These have a relaxed fit. They are warm and comfortable. Do not size up.
5.0,Great!! Really like the fit‚Ä¶lightweight and looks good.
5.0,"Nice comfortable cut for lounging around the house I like the weight of these sweats, not too warm, yet not thin, nice wide leg and ride well at natural waist"
5.0,Great standby! I love the wideness of the leg bottom distracting from my larger than life thighs.
5.0,Comfortable and Warm These pants are warm and fit nicely.  Well worth the price.
5.0,Comfortable Sweatpants These sweatpants were comfortable. Material is thick and doesn‚Äôt itch and irritates the skin when wearing them. They are not high waters and are lengthy. I got them in a few different colors.
5.0,"Love the warmth these give. True to size. I'm 5'5"", about 125 lbs and the Small is a really nice fit..not tight but not baggy either. Watm and extremely comfortable. Ordered 1, then 2 more after trying."
5.0,Comfortable Sweatpants These sweatpants were comfortable. Material is thick and doesn‚Äôt itch and irritates the skin when wearing them. They are not high waters and are lengthy. I got them in a few different colors.
5.0,"Watch out - size varies with color! Okay, so first I bought medium and small black to compare size- small fit perfect!! They took back the medium- no problem.Yeah a lot of fuzz came out in the dryer but they are still soft and fuzzy and I love them so much I decided to get another small pair in purple!!And as you Can see- the new pants are not the same size! This is not dryer shrink- the purple are too big! Same length though- a puzzle! Anyway, going to return and try small navy instead! May end up with two black pairs, who knows!"
5.0,"For the price I love them. Pants are soft and warm for our Texas weather. They are medium to light weight and after a while they pilled a little better the legs, no one sees that."
5.0,Good deal. Comfortable.

5.0,"Comfortable but but size smaller than normal Excellent price, but follow the reviews and get one full size smaller than you wear.  I'm 5'5"" 150 and normally choose medium or large.  Reviews said small, I got small - perfect for."

5.0,These are a terrific buy They fit so well and feels so soft and cozy
5.0,"WoW! I'm so glad I didn't go off of the reviews! I went with my normal size medium! I'm 5'5"" 150 lbs 27/28 waist.These fit on point! They're not cheaply made, very comfortable! They are not too long they're just right where you're not walking on them. I love how they don't have an elastic on the bottom of the legs! They fit over your tennis shoes and Sperry's perfectly!I got the dark gray color. These do not have pockets and that's a plus!I love these and will get a few more pair‚ù§Ô∏è"
5.0,"Good for recovery from surgery I ordered these for my wife, who's had orthopedic surgery on her leg.  The cuff is wide enough to pull over a cast, and the weight is just right for her long hours in a recliner, with her feet elevated.  She's happy!"
5.0,"This is the best Hanes one  I've ever bought. The main thing is the crotch fits where it is supposed to, and NOT half way down to my knees. The first pair  of pants I have not had to hem them up. I have washed them in cold water and dried them on medium heat and they do not shrink up. I can wear them straight out of the dryer!update: I now have 5 pr of these and they wash up lovely!"
5.0,"Comfortable Sweat Pants I got these sweat pants in a few different colors. They are comfortable, stretchy and soft to the skin. Definitely wear these on days for running errands and just want to feel comfortable. Definitely recommend."
5.0,Warm The fabric of these pants is sort of like sweat pants but without the stiffness. They are so comfortable and move with the body unlike sweat pants. They are extremely warm and soft
5.0,Nice pants Nice pants fits perfectly im a medium
5.0,Womens Open Bottom Leg Sweatpants Sweatpants that are long enough and do not  shrink during wash.  Color stays vibrant.  Fits perfect.  Think this is my 4th pair.
5.0,"Nice comfy They are comfortable & have a slight stretch, which makes them not binding. For the price they are a good value."
5.0,"Comfy Good lounge pants for around the house. They are just slightly short for me, and I would like a wider leg. I am usually a Large or XLarge, and I got size Large first, and they fit pretty well. I then ordered a second pair in XL hoping they'd be a little longer and baggier, but they were way too big. If you're on the L/XL, I'd stick with the large"
5.0,very comfortable they are very roomy and comfortable. They don't bind at the waist or ankles
5.0,"Great value for the money Really nice pants and a good weight.  Such a bargain for the price.  They've held up beautifully and wash and wear extremely well.  I've recently lost some weight, so ordered more of them in 3 colors."
5.0,Queda perfecto Muy buena calidad
5.0,Good buy ! Good buy for the $$$$
5.0,Comfy pants for a cold winter I like the softness of the material and the relaxed fit for comfort
5.0,"Hanes - Always good quality and worth the price Hanes - always a winner with quality, consistent sizing, good fabrics and quick turn around.  These are my go-to sweats.  They are one of the few manufacturers who make an open-leg sweatpant.  No elastic around the ankle.  OTG!P.S.  I always have to chuckle at the subject ratings for clothing on Amazon.  One of the questions is: Is it flattering?  Oh hahahhaa!  C'mon.  When are sweats EVER flattering?!?!?"
5.0,Their the best and GREAT to know I can still buy them. Nothing I disliked abt them.  Their exactly what I was looking for and couldn't.
5.0,"Nice looking sweats! I ordered a medium and the length and leg width are great but the waist band was too tight.  No drawstring so I snipped the elastic in a few places. They are now very comfortable and warmer than jeans and other types of sweats. I ordered the other colors, too."
5.0,"Good value. Order one size smaller, as recommended, and they fit very well."
5.0,"Warm and Comfortable Always have to hem anything I buy, even the petite is too long. These sweats are warm and comfortable for winter season. I would recommend these to any one. Can always trust Hanes."
5.0,"Waistband is well made, secure elastic, made to last Substantial fabric, warm, soft, not too thin or thick. Strong elastic waistband-not too constricting. Only issue is for larger petite sizes the length is a bit long."
5.0,"I love these warmup pants I‚Äôm 61, 5‚Äô6‚Äù, 190 lbs.  I ordered the large in white.  They are so comfortable and I love the wide legs.  The fleece is light.  I hope Hanes never stops making these."
5.0,Comfortable fit. Very comfortable.

5.0,great nice sweats long enough.. no pockets  only draw back
5.0,qualty the fit
5.0,Fit great They fit perfectly  wash great
5.0,The legs are wider than most. I bought these for my Mom who needs the wide leg at the foot. These are the best I have found. Too many others are tight at the ankle. These are perfect for her!
5.0,Perfect for hanging out at home These pants fit great.  Not thick pants but not too thin either.  Wash well.  I ordered 2 more pairs.
5.0,"Love Them These are very comfortable; I prefer them to leggings.  They are warm, with a loose comfortable fit."
5.0,"Wife like them The tag line says it all. Wife like these, and I think they are well made for the price."
5.0,"Warm addition Not flattering, but this weather who cares. They are nice and warm. Wish they had a draw string."
5.0,Comfortable Loved them so much a ordered two more pairs the same day!!  Comfy and cozy

5.0,Pants My mom loves them
5.0,"Standard Haynes Quality These pants are a light weight sweat pants.  Very comfortable for lounging around the house or doing housework.  If I need to run out, I feel the pants are okay for running errands."
5.0,"Great for lounge wear to keep warm! I was looking for some bottoms for loungewear around the house to keep warm in Michigan cold winters. Just got these today and were exactly what I was looking for at a great price.I would suggest that you order true to size, not to size up. True to size, they are comfortable and not tight.  These are by no means ""sexy"" sweatpants, LOL, they are functional and comfortable,  just what a girl needs sometime."
5.0,Comfortable fit Love these!  Fits perfect.
5.0,Very nice They fit nice
5.0,Great product Nice product for a elderly to easily pull them up.
5.0,"So comfy, favorite sweatpants These are SO comfortable. I‚Äôve had them well over a year and I have them in navy, black, and light gray. They are pretty much my go-to sweatpants. I come home and change into sweatpants or comfy pants every day, and these are the ones I keep on top at the front of the drawer, because I usually reach for them first. They hold just right at the hips, but are comfortably loose. They end a little above or right at the ankle. They are warm, but of course with the open bottoms, your calves will get chilly if you go for a walk in Michigan winter, even with wool socks on. That being said, wearing them around the house and outside, if I wear leg warmers or knee-high socks, is perfect because they‚Äôre super cozy. When I bought them, they were maybe around $8, so for the price, I couldn‚Äôt recommend them more."
5.0,Comfortable fit Nice comfortable fit for my wife to wear around the house on a cold day. Does fit a bit larger than normal size but that makes it comfy.
5.0,Great Love
5.0,These fit very comfortably. I wear these over my pajamas in the early morning to walk my dog. It is very cold and these pants make it bearable. They are warm and long enough to reach my tennis shoes. Perfect for what I need.
5.0,Pants Happy
5.0,It‚Äôs ok They are ok for the money
5.0,"Sizing may vary by color Extremely comfortable. I ordered two pairs, both in size small. The slate gray fits perfectly. Loose but not overly baggy and the waist is perfect. Strangely though, the light steel is overall larger and the waistband does not stay up. Would need X-small if it was available.Update: I washed the light steel in hot water and put in dryer for an hour in high, and now they fit perfectly!"
5.0,"machine wash and dry, non wrinkle, never needs pressing. When Hane's states a clothing color you can rely the color named will always match exactly any other Hanesclothing so named. So-have a ball and create new ensembles!"
5.0,"Soft, fits great, washes nice Perfect for all weather"
5.0,Best sweatpants! These sweatpants are so roomy and  cute. I am glad I ordered. 2 pairs - one in light gray and one in navy. May get a few more pairs for my Mom for Christmas!
5.0,Too big According to the measurements they have I‚Äôd wear a large but the medium fits perfectly. And there is no drawstring to decrease the waist size if it‚Äôs too big. Otherwise amazing for the price.
5.0,Runs huge Soft and comfortable however we definitely need to order down a size or two like many review was said. I ordered two different colors in the same size and they are huge. I wish they made an extra small. Overall though comfortable
5.0,Glad I bought two pair. So comfortable and I like the gray color I choose.
5.0,Very comfortable I love the wide legs and seem well made. I‚Äôm
5.0,Very nice It is a good buy
5.0,"Nice fabric So comfy for out on errands, great for comfort at home"
5.0,Nice and warm Needed something comfy to wear around the house and still be warm.  This was perfect.
5.0,"Very light weight I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3‚Äù, 140lbs and ordered a medium.  They‚Äôre a tad large and about 2-3‚Äô too long and didn‚Äôt shrink when I washed them so will order a small if I get them again.  Much lighter weight than I had expected but ok for the gym."
5.0,My granddaughter loves these pants! Very comfortable and stretchy!  They form to your leg size and shape!  Love these comfy sweatpants!
5.0,"Big for the size but that was what I was looking for. I love these pants, they are incredibly comfortable.  I knew they were going to run large and I bought a large instead of a small - I needed to be able to pull them way up under ""the girls"" when sitting day due to nerve damage from shingle.  I can sit fine, but a waistband rubbing along my stomach where I had shingles is still excruciating even with the rash gone.  I can comfortably pull them waaaay up, then when I need to wear them somewhat normal, I roll the waistband down and they stay in place nicely.  For normal people, I'd say go a size smaller OR wash them as soon as you get then in hot, hot water - then put in the dryer."
5.0,love it! runs big i gotten a small and the waist is still too big but i love these anyways. I can dress them up with a cute sweater or down with a crewneck
5.0,Fit great! Great fit and great price!
5.0,"Detailed Review I am 5'4''. I weigh 155lbs. I wear a size 11/12 - 13/14 in my jeans. I ordered a size medium in these pants. The size chart said that I should order a large, but I read the reviews that said these run big. The reviews are right. Buy a size smaller than recommended on the chart. The medium fits me perfectly. The waist is not too big or small. They are perfect. They are nice and long, but they don't drag the floor. They are extremely soft and comfortable. Wash before wear because of the paint type of smell (I always do this anyways.). These are just a basic sweatpant. Not sexy or form fitting anywhere. These don't fit like the kind you would find at a junior clothing store. If you are looking for something basic and extremely comfortable then these are it. Don't forget to size down."
5.0,Fits well The only thing to make this pant better would be to add pockets
5.0,"Size Matters! These pants are great, but huge! I normally wear an XL, but have to reorder in large!"
5.0,"Great value, ran a little big Great price, comfortable. Size was a little big."
5.0,Just as described. Fits perfectly. Arrived on time.
5.0,Good buy Very comfortable and warm.
5.0,"Perfect!!! Super comfy, fit great!  NOT skin tight!!!!"
5.0,good price Its a good price and comfortable fit.....
5.0,"These do run a little big ... measurements and details on fit in review body 5'2"" tall33.5"" waist42.5"" hipsBought size SmallI have a well defined waist, wide hips, a bubble butt (LOL), and thick athletic legs.  I would have normally bought a medium, but having read the reviews decided to try a small.The waistband fits perfectly, not too tight, not too loose.  They are a little too big in the belly area (in front below waist band and above crotch).Very comfortable in the hips... they fit flush to the hip, no extra ""bag"" but not tight at all.My bubble butt fits fine ... no extra ""bag"" at all, they fit snug but not tight. When I squat or bend over there is no dangerous pulling on the seams.Fit in the legs is just like boot cut jeans, and they JUST BARELY drag the ground in my barefeet.OVERALL:  Hanes always makes good product, the quality is awesome as expected.  I am very comfortable with the way they fit, and the plan is to buy several more pairs.I did also buy a medium, but I have not worn those yet and will review them separately.  After I have worn both I will add my final size choice to both reviews."
5.0,"Comfy sweatpants Ordered to wear while recovering from knee surgery, fit great and wash and dry well. Did not shrink."
5.0,Very soft fabric There are a little lose around my waste but they are very comfortable and I love the fabric I bought a size large I should of bought a medium
5.0,Cozy and comfy and good price.  Runs little large but still ok. Good price and comfy.
5.0,Love the fit Love the fit and fabric.  It's multi-seasonal and very comfortable.
5.0,There just a little big in waist but still very comfy I like them a lot I like that they  are very comfortable
5.0,Great! They are fine.  Flattering and comfortable.
5.0,Will buy these again Fit true to size. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7‚Äù and these are the perfect length. So comfortable. Will definitely buy again.
5.0,Affordable Nice product at reasonable price!
5.0,comfortable and warm Comfortable and warm.  Nice fit.
5.0,"Great fit, full of comfort and great price! These were exactly what I wanted. Fit perfect and so comfortable! The price is great too!"
5.0,"Liked them so much, I bought another pair Great value, super soft, comfortable. Not particularly flattering, but not too tight or uncomfortable. Very long. I'm 5'7"" and they almost hit the floor when barefoot. Most pants are too short on me. Rise was higher than typical, but didn't give a muffin top and was more comfortable when wearing for a long time or sitting. Washed perfectly. Did not shrink. I didn't realize when I bought them that they were made from recycled plastic, but still felt soft like normal fleece. Not quite as thick as typically heavyweight hoodie fabric, but not as thin as cheap sweats. Nice in between. Hanes sizing was very consistent in second pair. I bought charcoal/dark gray and then bought the light gray (not white as the pictures make it look). Other colors did not appeal to me or I would have bought more. Can't go wrong with this price."
5.0,Great pants for the $ fit well and comfortable
5.0,"Hanes Comfort Soft pants Very comfy, look good"
5.0,"Very Comfortable Sweatpant I bought one size smaller than I normally wear based on reviews from others. I generally wear medium size.I bought a small blue heather sweatpant.I am 5'4"" with a 30"" inseam length.My waist is 29.5""; hips is 36""I tried them on when received, the sweatpant is 2"" longer but I'm OK with that as I knew it would be a little long. I will wash them. The label says 50% cotton, 50% polyester, machine wash cold with like colors, inside out if decorated. Use only non-chlorine if needed. Tumble dry low. Cool iron if needed. Do not iron decoration.The sweatpant is a lightweight in fabric but a great bargain to me for comfort.  The fabric has a nice, soft feel to it.  They are very comfortable and I can wear them around the house or out and about. I'm happy with the fit and looks of this sweatpant."
5.0,"Fit perfectly and comfy! These sweatpants are very flattering, comfy, and have the perfect stretch!"
5.0,Very comfy. They are very comfortable and got right but a little to long but I am short I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2‚Äù. So maybe 2-3 inches to long but love that they are comfortable and I can just put on and go.
5.0,"Perfect Super comfortable and true to size. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3‚Äù and approx 185lbs. I got a large and they are perfect. Just a tiny bit long, but they‚Äôre fine for lounge pants."
5.0,"Ordered two pairs‚Ä¶ I was in a hurry to get some lounge pants in preparation for a surgery. Having read the reviews, I ordered both my regular size and a size smaller. I carry my weight in my thighs, so I‚Äôm always leery about the smaller size, but it was exactly right. The larger size is way too big around my waist. The fleece is lightweight, but not so thin that imperfections (AKA cellulite!) show through. I wear mine with a tunic length sweatshirt, and they make a stylish enough outfit that we can run errands without looking like I forgot to get dressed."
5.0,Comfort All about comfort and these sweatpants are exactly that
5.0,Bought several pairs over years ! Bought several pairs over last couple years.Great buy
5.0,"Small Just a bit big, wasn‚Äôt sure how the sizes run, there big but I wear"
5.0,"Great and affordable comfy pants.  But no pockets. Love them! Ordered more.  I am a medium usually so after reading all the other reviews I ordered the small.  They fit perfect.  Not too tight at all.  I am 5‚Äô5‚Äù, I weigh 140 lbs (maybe more now since our state has been on stay home orders for a month and all we do is eat).  I was worried about the length because it wouldn‚Äôt let me select the petite size.  But these Hanes pants are just a slightly long with no shoes on but not so much I‚Äôm tripping on them.  Just stepping on them with my heel.  But with gym shoes on they are fine.  I was looking for affordable comfy lounge pants that are decent enough to go out and get the mail with or run to the grocery store if I had to and these are perfect! I got the colors that were on sale.  So all of them were less than $8.00 at the time I ordered mine."
5.0,"Just PERFECT ! I have been reading the reviews, especially the 1-2 stars, and did not want to buy at first. I figured the low reviews must be right considering the low price.But then, later on, due to the low price I decided to give it a try and got 3 pairs, different colors.What do you know ? They are just PERFECT !What I love the most is that they fit perfect in the waist, not to low, not to high, the elastic band is wide, well made and holds just right, firm secure yet comfortable.  I am 158 lb and got a M (medium).I just realized that I have an other old Hanes pair, which I've been using for years and I was very happy with them.So, lets hope they are the same quality and will last me for many years to come.VERY happy with the purchase :)"
5.0,Very comfortable. I‚Äôm happy. It‚Äôs fitting very easily and very comfortable. Thanks
5.0,Nice everyday pants Very comfortable with neat appearance for everyday errands
5.0,"Order according to size chart. Ridiculous sizing with these.  I am 5'5"" and weigh 115 and normally take an 8 but like to get a 10 because I don't want them to be ""fitted"". I ordered a M in these.  OMG!  Incredible too that each color has a different, but monstrous size to it.  The light steel ones would have fallen off if I wouldn't have been holding the huge waist! I was going to exchange them for a S, but after reading the reviews didn't think it would help.  Too bad. They are packed up ready to go to UPS. What a pain!UPDATE: I had to come back and add more stars to my review.  I checked out the size chart and according to that I should have ordered a S which I ended up doing. I figured if they didn't fit I could return them but...the small size came today and they fit me perfect and are still not tight.  Very happy with them now and love that they don't have ties or anything.  Super comfortable and look nice enough to wear even to the grocery store! I just ordered 2 more pair and will probably donate the bigger ones I didn't keep the packaging from and can't return."
5.0,Soft and warm fits great...warm  great price
5.0,Warm Comfortable fit
5.0,"Soft and cozy Warm and comfortable,  lay around relax in comfort"
5.0,"Basic cozy sweatpants Long after they were no longer presentable enough to be seen outside my home, I allowed my last pair of sweatpants to retire after a long and appreciated career. Strangely, the quest to replace them was difficult, probably bc it should have been so simple. All that I wanted a pair of basic, pull on, cozy sweatpants with a decent shape and drape to them, made from (at least 50%) cotton. I tried many higher end resources/stores and none came close. Then I saw these on Amazon and the price was too good to pass up. I thought that even if they were just something to use in the interim until I found ""the"" replacement, that would be fine. Lo and behold, $7.50 later, I find that these are my ultimate basic sweatpants. I'm shocked. Best $7.50 that I ever spent."
5.0,Super Comfy I've lost weight recently and needed a smaller size. These have been a staple for me for years.
5.0,it fits my fat ass..!!!! yes
5.0,Very comfortable These are very comfortable ans warm! So happy to find them in different colors too!
5.0,"Comfortable and washed well - Go down a size Okay, for my current lifestyle, these pants are perfect, and I would buy them again.  As other reviewers have mentioned, the sizes run a bit large.  I generally order XL, but in these pants I took their advice and ordered LARGE, which fits fine.The length was too long for me, but I ran them through the washer and dryer before wearing them, and that reduced the overly-long problem somewhat.  Otherwise, I did not notice any shrinkage.  They still fit me fine.The pants are comfortable to wear around the house and yard, easy care, nice looking.  I would wear them to the grocery store, for sure.  And, of course, the price is quite reasonable as well.  Thanks.  K"
5.0,Comfy Very comfortable
5.0,A perfect gift ! A perfect gift!
5.0,"Shrunk them to Size I'm 5'3"" and about 110 lbs. I got these pants in a small and found them to run big like other reviewers had said. I've been looking for this style of sweatpants for a long time though, so instead of retuning them I decided to try shrinking them. It worked! I washed them in hot water and dried them to find they fit great now! I compared my shrunk pair to a new pair and found they had both shrunk in the length and waist. I tried the same treatment to my second pair and got the same great results!"
5.0,"If you like baggy fit buy your size, if not size down! Exactly what I wanted! Comfy baggy sweatpants! They do run big tho!"
5.0,"Can't beat the quality for the price These pants are perfect for my winter jogs. They are great quality and keep me warm during the jog, and then easy to toss in the wash. And at this price, you can have a pair for every day, and you don't have to fret if they wear out. They haven't shrunk on me in the wash at all. My only slight complaint was that they did start to sag down when I tie my sweatshirt around my waist and try to run, I imagine that wouldn't been a problem if they had a tie there, but I didn't want pants with a tie (they always get caught in the waistband!) so if that bothers me too much I'll just get a different pair that has them. All in all, great pants!"
5.0,Love the fit. Very comfy.
5.0,"Sooo very comfortable These pants are incredibly comfortable.  They are wonderfully soft, both on the inside and outside.  They are so light-weight, it almost feels like not wearing pants at all. Yet, they are still able to keep you warm.  These are pants that can be worn all year long at home lounging around, working, or exercising. My only complaint is that they don't have pockets.  They would be perfect pants if they had pockets.  Full disclosure: even though I gave them 5 stars, I would really give 4.5 stars if I could because of the lack of pockets.  However, they are so comfortable, I could not lower the score to 4.  I definitely plan to get a second pair."
5.0,"So comfortable - work approved Working from home has taken a toll. I no longer ""dress"" for work, nor do I even slip on those cute jeans. (They no longer fit) But these sweat pants fit, and I have them in every color. they are soft and comfortable. And if they are a little bigger than you expect, that is ALL good. You clearly have lost weight! And they don't shrink in the dryer! This is huge. I hate it when my pants and/or t-shirts shrink. It sends the wrong message and can be confusing. Have I gained weight? Am I getting shorter from slouching? Thankfully, I do not struggle with those harmful thoughts with these. Just toss in the wash and then dry - presto, you are ready for another week at work. Buy a pair in every color."
5.0,"perfect fit; very soft and comfy. I wanted a loose fit, and I would have bought the large, but since the reviews stated the pants run large, I bought a medium.  Great fit! I am close to 5' 8"" tall, 140 lbs. The pants are slightly loose but not huge on me.  The fit is great for working around the house.  I did not buy them to wear outside my home.  I already have several of the Hanes sweat shirts. This is a perfect outfit for cool days.  I bought the light grey and will probably get another pair. They washed up nicely in cold water, and I dried them on the lower setting to avoid shrinking.  They came out of the machine in perfect order."
5.0,SUPER COMFY ...and I love the color!
5.0,Very comfortable Live these for the winter! Very comfortable and warm!I‚Äôm going to buy another pair for the winter!
5.0,I expected it to run large from the note so ordered a medium instead of large.  Perfect Great for lounging comfort and also warm
5.0,"Comfy Pants but watch Size Very Nice Comfy Pants, watch your size though! If yous short these will be long too! Purchased pair at 5'3 and step on bottom all the time! But so comfy and cute honestly for price! Lounge great in!They run very big though I suggest ordering 2 sizes down! Trust me or you will end up with the hassle of returning! Took me two times! Two sizes down and remember run long if short! But very comfy and if wear with shoes will bump them up. Lounge wear they will drag some..."
5.0,"Simple, perfect sweatpants I ordered five different sweatpants, and these are the only ones I'm keeping. They fit the best, and they also happened to be the cheapest (less than $10 when I got them).Heads up that mine were initially too long when they arrived, but the length is perfect after washing them (on cold) and drying them. (I'm a normal inseam on most jeans, leaning toward short.)These have a thin, soft fleece lining, but they're not overly warm like heavy fleece PJ bottoms are -- exactly what I wanted for lounging in a temperature-controlled home.The only possible con I can think of is that they don't have pockets, but that's not a deal-breaker for me on sweatpants.Well worth the money! I'm ordering another pair in another color."
5.0,Great job explaining the pants I like the comfort
5.0,"Comfy, great price, good quality I'm around a size 16 and bought these in 2XL. They're super loose at the waist and the legs are really wide, so this size is definitely too big of you're a size 16! But I wouldn't say they necessarily ""run large."" I just bought too big a size. (I ended up buying another pair in XL and they're perfect.)Pros:- Great for the price.- The insides are VERY soft. Like ""freshly shaved legs"" soft. Love it.Cons:- I'm 5'6"" and my height is more in my legs than my torso, and the 2XL was *still* long on me. Wearing these at my natural waist, the hems go an inch past my heels. So if you're larger around the middle but average to short in height, these are going to swallow you."
5.0,Great fit These are a good fit
5.0,"Perfect for short People! I love these sweat pants- in fact I ordered another pair! They are comfortable, and warm."
5.0,"I LOVE THESES PANTS! I love these pants! I needed comfortable pants to wear at home, now that I work here 4 days out of the week, and was searching Amazon for quality, but not over priced pull-on pants. Most of the reviews state they run small...I usually wear a large and bought the black in a medium, and loved them so much, I bought three more pairs in different colors  . Perfect fit, a tad bit long. I am 5'3"" so this is expected, there are many taller persons out there who will need the length to be longer. They are so comfy and look  much nicer in person, with a nice T-shirt and dress tennis shoes, I would definitely wear these to the grocery or casually shopping!"
5.0,comfortable pants run extremely long!
5.0,"Great for the price For the price, these are great. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6‚Äù and 138 lbs. I purchased a medium because I can‚Äôt stand to wear anything that is tight (my tight is what others would call normal). I‚Äôm a pear shape and although these are a little large in the waist, my hips and stomach keep them up lol. I could have gotten a small in these but they would have been too tight for my liking. I have other Hanes where a medium fits me perfectly; these are a bit bigger (but that‚Äôs fine with me). They‚Äôre not the longest pants, either, but will look okay with sneakers. I really like the weight of these as well. So many ‚Äúsweatpants‚Äù are very thin these days.They‚Äôre sweatpants and they‚Äôre $7.50. If you‚Äôre going to run to the store in them, walk the dog, and mostly hang out, they‚Äôre great. I just ordered another pair."
5.0,"Love these! Love these, but they do run large.  Recommend ordering a size down."
5.0,"Love all four pair! I purchased Four pair, petite medium.  I was a 74 year old 5‚Äô6‚Äù 155+lb formerly fit Grammy who spent  COVID reading instead of exercising.  In Feb, I decided to live in sweats thinking they would jumpstart my exercise program.  They did NOT, but I love them.  I have solid, sturdy legs.  These fit nicely.  They come to my shoe top, they fit at my waist, but note, my height is in my torso not my legs.  I put them in washing machine on cold, and while I have put them in dryer, I usually shape them (shake them out)) and let them air dry.  They are great!"
5.0,Great material..runs large..hopefully will shrink when washed and dried. Liked material..runs large Hopefully will shrink in wash.
5.0,"The grey color is just what I was looking for Given changes with my physical body structure, I am going away from wearing leggings/jeggings, to a looser fitting yoga pant. This pair of sweatpants from Hanes is exactly what I was looking for. The length and fit are perfect. The pant leg is roomy but not too much, so that I am still able to do my yoga stretches safely. This is for the grey color only. I also purchased the identical pant in the black color, and it is not fitting the same. The pants are at least 1 inch longer, and the waist is at least 1 inch bigger. These will be returned. It's confusing and a bit unsettling when the same manufacturer produces a different product, based on the color one purchases."
5.0,They fit well and look great. even on my dumpy frame. I haven't found anything I don't like about them as yet. What I do like about them is I put the black pair in the washer and added more clothes with out thinking about it. Later during the washer like a light bulb going off in my head I thought every thing in there was going to be gray because of the black slacks. So I held my breath until the load finished. And lo and behold every thing was perfect. Another sore spot in my head is not petite sizes. I'm round and short so I had to cut off 6 inches and hem each of them.
5.0,"Loved These Pants! I don't know what all the complaints were about - these pants fit me perfectly! The rise, length, seat - all perfect. I normally wear an 18-20 and I ordered an xx large. I wish they were still available in more colors - I'd buy them all!Note: I have not washed and worn them yet. If shrinkage and/or pilling becomes an issue, I will update my review.UPDATE: They washed well (dried on medium) but after one day of wearing, they did pill in the crotch. I'm disappointed - especially since I ordered 3 more pairs! I de-pilled them and will wear them again and see what happens. Still, for $7.50, can I expect more? I would gladly pay 3x's this amount for a good quality, good fit sweatpants."
5.0,"Better than your average sweat pants I ordered the purple color in XL.  I am 5'9"" and weigh 209.  The XL fits very comfortable, almost a bit too big, but not so big that they aren't just totally comfortable.  I won't wear sweat pants in public, but these make me feel like I'm not really wearing sweat pants, so I have no problem running my errands and wearing them out.  These are also long, so they aren't complete high water on me, like I find with a lot of pants.  I am an ""apple"" shape, meaning I carry my weight in my middle.  I don't have any hips or butt, so this may be why they tend to be a bit baggy in those areas."
5.0,"So warm not hot and so comfortable. Lounging around, shopping. Just perfect. I'm ordering a second pair."
5.0,"Love these sweats! So far I have bought four matching sets, and another pair of grey/steel pants.  They do run large as  advertised.  I dropped down one size and they fit me nicely.  I hope they  wash well.  We'll see.  In  hot weather, the pants will be worn with light weight short sleeved or tank tops.  Only down side is the fact that the pants are four  inches too long for me.  And I am not short!! And, I wish they had at least one pocket.  During the cold, cold weather here in Texas when I had no electrical service for nearly 36 hours, I slept in sweatpants and sweatshirt and stayed very comfortable.  Thanks, Hanes."
5.0,"Love Everything About These I love these. I live in Southern California and these are perfect for my morning walks when the weather is in the 50s. I usually wear a medium, so that's what I ordered. They fit perfectly; the waistband isn't too tight and the length is perfect (to the top of my sneaker.) Since they are a poly/cotton blend, they are soft. I have washed them a few times and no lint; they wash and dry like a dream. I ordered them in two colors (gray and purple) and even thinking of a third. I also wear them around the house when the weather is chilly. They are cozy and keep me warm."
5.0,"Finally pants that fit Searched for weeks, finally found pants  that fit"
5.0,"Very comfortable These are super soft and comfortable but they run large. The small is a little too big for me in the waist, but the length is perfect. I'm not bothered by them being a little too big since I bought them to wear around the house."
5.0,"Fit well I'm 5'3"" and 155 lbs.  Normally wear a size L or 12/14 in women's pants.  I took the advice of previous reviewers and ordered a size down, and I'm glad I did.  Size M fits perfectly, perfect length.  Quality seems acceptable - I've washed mine at least 10 times now and they've held up just fine.  These pants are perfect for wearing around the house, and I've even worn them out on quick errands.  No, they're not sexy, but when I'm sitting at my computer all day you can only see me from the waist up, so comfort and durability are most important to me.  I would definitely order again."
5.0,"Surprised me with a great fit. I have been ordering this brand/model of sweat pants from Walmart but when I gained a little weight and my size M was getting a little tight they were out of this color and I found it here on Amazon. Even though I wear a L in Hanes pants now I've been buying XL so that they are long enough that my ankles don't get exposed to the winter temps while riding my Trike. All the other sweat pants are so loose around the waist I'll have to put in a drawstring in order to wear them, but not these. I was shocked when I put them on the first time that they fit perfectly. I have read reviews for Hanes sweat pants that say the size fluctuates with the color. I've never seen it to this extent but this XL Deep Dive Heather sweat pant fits me like a large but with the extra length. I'm debating whether to buy another pair in this color."
5.0,Wash and dry well Lost weight and needed new sweats!
5.0,"Very comfortable, purchased another pair I agree with other reviewers that these run a little large, but since I wanted these for loungewear/sleep pants with maybe the occasional trip outside for a little snow shoveling or walk the dog type of activity, it‚Äôs no problem. They‚Äôre extremely comfortable and a nice medium/medium light weight; certainly heavier than the almost t-shirt weight some sweats are made of today but not what I consider heavy. In fact, after wearing them for a couple of days, I decided to get another pair or two as they‚Äôre a great price and perfect for my purposes. No idea at this point how they‚Äôll wear, but the initial pair doesn‚Äôt show signs of pilling so far, and again, since I just intend to wear them around the house, wear isn‚Äôt a huge concern for me."
5.0,Comfy I bough it when it was on sale. I bought medium and it‚Äôs comfy for sleeping. A bot loose but not too loose. I use it on cold winter nights. These aren‚Äôt itchy too.
5.0,Very light weight and comfortable Very happy with this product super light weight yet super coverage. I bought 4 pairs of shorts in the same fabric and size. They are perfect.
5.0,Definitely size down I read the reviews before purchasing an ordered a size down. I'm usually an extra large in pants so I got a large instead. With the large it's still a bit room left which I'm perfectly fine with because at least it feels comfortable and it's very soft. I don't understand why some of the reviews said that they wouldn't wear it during the winter. I feel like these would be perfect during the winter time. Some others also said that they wouldn't wear it outside they would just wear it inside but I don't see what the issue is with wearing it outside. They will be perfect with some leg high or knee high fuzzy boots
5.0,comfort all day--at home or away What can I say--comfort all day
5.0,"After Several Washings Length Shrunk Up Several Inches I am 5"" 5"" and 125  pounds.  Waist 26.5-27-ish  Hips 36.5-37=ish' Inseam 29.5. Inches.  The pants were long for me right out of carton. However, after several washes (cold water) and dryer (set to normal not high heat), my pair shrunk up several inches and now fit perfectly. Didn't seem to shrink the waist or hips...just length of pant. I just wore them anyway at the beginning and washed when needed. I didn't try to shrink them. It may be different for you but that is how it worked out for me.  I bought two more pair. Love them. Not sloppy or baggy on me; not too tight anywhere. Just right :)"
5.0,"Finally found the perfect sweatpants!! I have been searching for sweats and ordering several styles. None fit me as well as these. I went back and ordered three more pairs. So warm and cozy and soft. The waist is at the perfect place and I am so happy with this purchase. Highly recommend. No pockets, but I don't expect to need them in the house. All in all, the perfect sweatpants. UPDATE !!!!  So, I have been wearing these everyday since I bought four pairs. They have been repeatedly washed and dried and they hold up so well. Still soft and cozy comfortable. Just perfect for around the house. I highly recommend these and order your regular size."
5.0,good fit very good
5.0,Not petite Pants fit pretty well but I am not petite.  I am 5'6 and tall.  Length js perfect.  I panicked we hen I saw petite and tried to cancel the order.  Pants are a little too big in the waist but when I wash them the dryer we I'll fix that.  The only negative is the materal attracks every piece of lint.  On the whole comftable and long enough.
5.0,"Good Quality and Great Seller! The pants were of terrific quality and the Seller was great to work with. Unfortunately due to my wife being petite in height, the pants fit everywhere but were too long. We requested a refund and I promptly received a response from the Seller. The refund was issued but then the Seller said we didn't have to return them! In the sign of a rare company that cares, they gave us a refund and said for us to just donate the new pants to a charity. How terrific is that?! We will do business with this Seller again!"
5.0,New sweats The fit is perfect
5.0,"Excellent purchase! I didn't know what to expect when I first ordered, but this item exceeded my expections especially at the price point.  It is a relaxed fit, but not ridiculously so.  The rise and the leg length are perfect for me.  The extra room in the hip and thigh doesn't bulge out, but just offers enough movement and yet the silouette skims the body without adding bulk.  I puchased a second pair in gray and will probably purchase a couple more for the Fall season."
5.0,"I LOVE HANES SWEATS . . . Love Hanes Sweat.... tried some of 'off' brands at 'box store' and they didn't wash well and stretched out in a matter of a week or two....  NOT HANES... they are worn everyday for at least a few hours and as long as HANES is available, I will ONLY buy HANES . . . they wash and wear well, are comfortable, and FIT PROPERLY.  THANK YOU !  Suggestion:  Need some more colors ! !"
5.0,Comfortable and warm but not too warm. These pants fit very comfortably. They are nice to wear around the house or even out to eat.
5.0,great great
5.0,Loved it I love the feel.
5.0,"So very comfortable I finally found something to wear that is long enough but doesn't drag the ground. They are loose enough, not skin tight, but in no danger of falling off my hips. If you want pure comfort, these are for you. The material is soft and slightly thick, but unlike the thickest sweatpants in my closet. The rise is below my belly button and ride just above my hips. Not for those who like tight skinny jeans, but for those who want a little less constriction. Perfect fit for me, and no, I didn't order a size down. I ordered my normal size."
5.0,"Love Hanes I believe I've bought 10 ten pair of these Hanes sweatpants this winter season. I've always loved Hanes. There were several color options available @ good prices. I like the open ankle pants. They are soft, warm, comfortable. I suggest using a dryer sheet in the washer which helps to keep them soft. I found them to be ""vanity sized."" A medium fit me like an XL so I sized down. Still the fit was very loose which I like. I have no doubt that I will continue to purchase these as the need arises."
5.0,very freaking comfy! washed it a couple times and still feels good to wear it !
5.0,"Great quality for the price! I‚Äôve worn this brand for years which is why I ordered these. Great quality for the price. My caboose needs a bit larger size than my waist requires, so for me that makes the waist a little too large, but I think that may be just on me. And it‚Äôs not really a problem. They did shrink a little after the first wash, which I was expecting, but not any more after that. These will last a loooong time, I‚Äôm sure, as others of this brand have. And I practically live in them in the winter. I would definitely recommend them."
5.0,"light weight and comfy I liked these so much I just ordered 2 more pairs in other colors.  I am 5'9"" but I wear a small so it is often difficult for me to get pants that fit. I took a chance with these because it said 31"" long which is a good length for me.  These do run large but I don't mind.  They are to wear around the house and hanging out.  I am in Florida and can't stand anything tight or heavy in this heat.  These are great.  They are loose and light weight and no tie waists which I love.I would recommend."
5.0,Pants fit ok for casual wear Fit ok for casual wear
5.0,"Great value and super comfy! I would highly recommend these if you're looking for basic sweatpants! You seriously can't beat the price and comfort of these. I normally wear a size 12 in jeans and ordered a Large and they fit but are a bit baggy in the legs and a I could roll the waistband if I wanted. I still wear them just fine but I ordered a second pair in Medium and they fit around my waist a bit better so I would recommend sizing down if you don't want them too baggy in the legs. Otherwise, I find them super soft and will be ordering all of the colors!"
5.0,Loose fit This product fit loose.
5.0,"Comfy! I love these sweatpants.  Very warm and cozy, soft, and if you follow Amazons suggestion for size, fit perfect.  I‚Äôm normally a medium/large in pants as I like a little room. But I ordered a small and they fit just how I like - a little loose in the legs and has some space around the waist."
5.0,"I would order again The cut and fabric are very good quality and I would order again.I'm returning my 3 orders for a Meduim size because I didn't go by the size chart and instead went off a a review on here from someone who got a large,who is 5'6 and weighs 144lbs. (my fault for not following size chart)I'm 5'7 and 155lbs. The large is really big on me, it would fall off of me if I didn't hold it up. Too bad there's no drawstrings for i could've made it work using it for lounge pants."
5.0,"Order 1 size down for best fit I carry my weight in my stomach and I wear a women's size 14. I ordered these in 2 sizes, large and medium. I ordered large 1st. Fits me like a 16. I gotta constantly pull them up cause they try to slip down a bit. Large will be perfect for my bloated days. Medium fits me perfectly. I like to wear these to take my son to his job and to pick him up too. They're not too warm, not tight. They're just right. A medium fits a 41"" waist."
5.0,"So comfortable! I probably should have ordered size M instead of L.  At 155 lbs it was hard to know.  I bought these in two colours and they arrived yesterday.  They are a little long, but I think that is actually better bc they can go into the dryer and not experience too much shrinkage.  They are SUPER comfy soft fleece, open at the bottom so they look and feel more like pants than athletic gear.  Nice quality, cant beat the price either.  I am working from home this year so I look forward to toasty warm comfort this winter.  Great buy."
5.0,"Love these! bought 2 then bought 2 more! Excellent lounge pants for working from home and not feeling like a slob wearing sweats or jammy pants. These fit so comfortable and look nice enough I can throw on shoes and run to the store and not look unkempt. The fabric is a good weight for northern winters but not too hot to wear in the house.Edit - after washing and drying twice, the heather gray pair have shrunk in length about 2 inches. They are waaay too short on me.  The black, light gray and heather blue have laundered fine and still look great."
5.0,"Order a Size Down Based on the other reviews, which said to order a size smaller than usual, I ordered both a medium and a small size. My regular size in pants is 8 or 10 depending on the brand and style.  To my surprise, the small size fit perfectly around the waist and hips. The medium was too loose around the waist and I will be returning it.  The fabric is soft and comfortable. It did not shrink in length or width when washed.  Heather navy is a very nice medium blue color."
5.0,"Love them Listen - these aren't the highest quality pants. I have had them for a few months and there's some piling between the legs and the material is kinda thin. All of that being said - I actually really love them. I wasn't looking for luxury with these, Mostly just wanted them to lounge around in. They are incredibly comfortable and fit true to size. I am ridiculously short so I had to hem them but they would be perfectly fine for average heights."
5.0,Very soft and great fit I really liked how comfortable they are. I bought these be baptized in and they were a beautiful White and so soft. Great price on top of that!
5.0,"Warm and cozy The sweatpants are very soft and warm. Was hard to find sweats that didn't cling around ankle. Wanted open pant style and these did the trick. VERY happy I purchased them. I ordered an XL but they were too big, returned and got the L. I would order a size smaller as they run big.  Ordered 2 of them and would order  again"
5.0,"Very comfy, but runs big. These pants are very soft and warm. The navy heather is very pretty, but not very dark. They do run big. I wear a size 10-12 jeans and the size large was BIG! I will keep them to wear around the house as lounge pants. A medium would have been a better fit. I am 5‚Äô1 and weigh 143."
5.0,"Great Value but Runs BIG Glad I saw others post these ran large and to order a size down.  I usually order large b/c I like my sweatpants kind of baggy and comfy.  I ordered medium - and I got baggy and comfy, lol.  Seriously, they do run large.  I've only washed/dried them once but the didn't shrink much if any.  The waist being a band instead of outright elastic makes them feel a little too loose for my liking 0 wiush they had a drawstring.  Still, all in all I'm happy with them."
5.0,"Great pants! They are soft and seem to be well made.  Material is not too heavy.  I bought an XXL and normally wear a size 20 or 22 jeans. Waistband is not too tight,  they fit great!  I'm 5'8"" and the length is perfect."
5.0,"Runs large but excellent sweats! These pants run large for sure. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8, 155 pounds,  a booty and then somewhat athletic build, and I wear a large in most skirts, dresses, or pants. Obviously with Sweats you want roomy and comfy but these were gigantic. I had to roll the waist band to get them to stay on. I am keeping the 2 pairs in size large that I bought and will give to my husband and I ordered 3 new pairs in medium and am hoping those fit better. They‚Äôre SUPER soft and I can‚Äôt wait to get the mediums! Worth the $7.50 per pair!"
5.0,"Runs big I love these sweats.  So very comfortable.  I sized down one size. They are a very comfortable fit, not too tight, not too loose, just right.  If anything they are just a bit loose, nothing that affects the look.  Now the length is long.  However, I found if I am wearing them with a sneakers with a higher sole they fit perfectly.  If you plan on wearing them with sandals or flat sole shoes, you will need to hem them.  I doubt they will shrink much if at all.  I bought two more pair as I found them to be a really good bargain."
5.0,"X-Large Middle Rise Sweatpant - Great Look and Fit These pants are really comfortable and have a great fit. I'm 204 lbs and 5'6"" and the length and fit are perfect (I bought X-Large).I carry my weight in my legs and fitting in pants is always an issue, but these fit great right out of the box.  I thought I'd miss having pockets and a drawstring but these offer a very smooth, slimming fit. They're a bit warm for sunny SoCal but we are having our share of rain and cooler weather. It's in the 60s today and the light fleece lining is perfect. They are comfy like pajamas but look great and I would not hesitate to go out wearing these, especially since the fleece makes them thick enough to not be see-through. I would definitely buy them again and you can't beat the price."
5.0,"Good pants but snug I like these pants.  The fabric is nice and heavy for colder weather and the length is good.  I ordered a size smaller as many of the reviews suggested and they are a little more snug in the thighs than I would like.  Since there is no drawstring at the waste, they may have been too big if I had ordered a larger size.  They have stretched a little since I have had them on, but not like my normal, roomy, sweatpants.  They are fine for around the house though."
5.0,"Great Deal for the Money I really like the fit on these pants -- no pockets to make a bulge under a shirt and relatively sleek.  I won't say that they are ""dress"" sweats, but they're fine for every day.  I looked long and hard to find pants like these, and they serve my needs -- especially for the price.  The length is perfect (I'm 5'7"") -- I don't dry them in the dryer, as I don't want them to shrink.  If you're significantly shorter, these might be too long.  Significantly taller, maybe too short."
5.0,"Love them.. Look so much better on. These are great for around the house or to go out paired with the right top.  They run a bit big so I would size down, but the material is great quality and the fit is perfect if you like high waisted. I'm very short wasted so I just roll them down. I have to do this with most paints.  I'm going to order another pair today in a different color.  LOVE THEM"
5.0,Cozy pants I own these in  black and gray and love them they‚Äôre really warm definitely baggier then other sweatpants I own they do not come with a drawstring in them so just be aware of that when you‚Äôre ordering. I wear a size 18 pant at most stores and I got the XXL but I like that they‚Äôre big and cozy they‚Äôre not formfitting at all. I think if you want them to fit a little tighter go down a size if you‚Äôre in between sizes as they have stretch to them
5.0,"Most comfy trou, bar none They looked too small, though plenty long enough, but they fit perfectly! I'm 5'4"" and about 180 and the XL was made for me. I don't recall ever wearing a more comfortable pant. Warm and soft, they feel snuggly. I'm buying more of them. Since I work from home, this is all I wear."
5.0,"perfect the pants fit right underneath my stomach, i adore these pants. i am bigger in the butt part and the pants don‚Äôt fall or anything of the sort."
5.0,"Way Too Long! I bought two of these thinking they looked soft and comfy for a cold night. I was not disappointed in the softness or the warmth, but the length was waaaaaay too long for a medium. I am 5'5"" and the legs almost covered my toes! When I tried to return them for a refund, they would only reimburse me for ONE. Very disappointing.If you are 5'7"" or taller, I'd say these are just right for you. But for those of us mediums who are ""average"", these will disappoint. üòï"
5.0,Absolutely the best I love these. This is my second pair. Extremely comfortable and durable. I wear them all the time since I work from home. Waist band is thick and doesn't dig in. The pant let is straight leg but not narrow. These are not skinny sweatpants that make your legs look even fatter. These are straight down from the thigh so they make you look thinner. The fit is perfect. They are so inexpensive and so well made and comfortable. Style is great. I love them!!!!
5.0,Senior Support This was sent to a senior in a nursing home.
5.0,"Very comfortable During the pandemic, I sit in my office chair much more than usual.  And have gained some extra pounds. These sweat pants have a straight leg from the hip down.  Lots of room for sitting.  If I do need to get up, while on camera, they look like black slacks.  I am 5'6"", 143 lbs. and the medium is a very comfortable fit. Not tight around the butt and thighs.  For the price I bought 3.  I bought my mom two pairs, in petite."
5.0,"Pants to live in Just ordered my second pair. I‚Äôm basically living in these pants since I work from home. They are absolutely the most comfortable, well fitting pants ever. I have a hard time finding pants that fit since I‚Äôm a plus size and tall. Even after washing and drying they keep their fit. Nice enough to wear out for errands and walks. The only negative is the first pair did separate at the seam in a couple of places after wearing twice and they do start to pill. Very warm since inside is fleece. Highly recommend."
5.0,"Excellent Price and Quality I first purchased a medium regular length , the pants were 4 inches too long and ran big.  I am 5'2"" and 118 lbs. I then puchased a petite medium.  The length was good but the size was too big.  I will donate them.  Finally, I puchased a small petite.  They are a perfect and delightfully warm.  After finding my size, I am please with price and quality.  Given all the sizes ordered, I really can't offer an overall rating."
5.0,"Shrinks in the dryer I ordered a large because I planned to put them in the dryer.  I'm 5'3"" and weigh 150 pounds.  When I tried them on out of the package, they were very loose in the waist and the legs were extremely long.  I washed them on hot and put them in the dryer on hot.  Now they fit perfectly!  Great value for money.  I only wear them around the house, so they are just what I wanted."
5.0,"Nice just a little large. What I was looking for just a little large in waist. Saw to order size smaller, and I did, but the medium is still large on me. I ordered my Mom a large, and probably should have gotten her a medium. Will see how they fit after washing them. Right length for me, but I'm 5' 8""."
5.0,Great comfy sweats. Very comfy
5.0,"Comfy pants, no pockets These are great sweatpants! I was searching for sweats with pockets and so I assumed these did and I didn‚Äôt check, alas, no pockets for me, but it‚Äôs my own fault. They‚Äôre exactly what I ordered and great for lounging/sleeping."
5.0,These run big I ordered large and and they are way too big for me. I wear a size 10 and if I decide to order again I will order size medium. I might donate to charity because I can't wear them. If I order again size medium would be fine
5.0,Good Good
5.0,"Size way, way down I'm 5'5"" 145lbs, I NEVER fit into a size small so I ordered the mediums initially but they were too large and too long (I don't like my heel stepping on the pants leg when I'm barefoot). I ordered the small and these fit perfectly, snug but not tight, good length (only slightly too long). Otherwise pretty happy, these are thick and soft. I wish they had pockets and would be willing to pay a few dollars more if they did, but for $7.50 these are a great deal!"
5.0,Comfortable I got these for my mom she‚Äôs 94 Straight leg makes it easy to take on and off we got three colors and she loves them
5.0,"as described These pants were exactly as described, and importantly, as reviewed. They sit just slightly above my hipbone and they definitely run large, as other reviewers have noted, because the small is a bit loose on me. (I usually wear a size 6 and my hip measures 37"". I'm 5'9"" and they are just long enough.) They came through the wash/dry looking and wearing as great as they did just out of the package. I'm happy with them and anticipate wearing them around the house through the coming winter. They aren't thick, and the fleece interior isn't all that fleecy, but they aren't advertised otherwise. Since they're a bit loose, on colder days I might pull them on over my fleece-lined tights. I'm happy with them."
5.0,So comfy These are so comfy and warm! I love these so much I bought another pair and a pair for my daughter. I would recommend hanging to dry because the black pair did shrink a little bit after drying them. And we got an XL and they fit well. Would buy again.
5.0,"Large in the waist but very comfortable I have bought these Hanes sweatpants for years at a local store but they stopped selling them this year. They do run large but after wearing them and washing them a lot, they fit better and are very comfortable for lounging around the house. I'm glad I can still purchase them on Amazon. The sizing is off-Medium is too small on me and Large is too big so I order Large and eventually they fit better after washing many times."
5.0,"Great sweat pants I appreciate the mid rise and wide waistband. Personally, I dislike drawstrings and narrow waist bands. It is hard to find this in men's sweats. I an 6'2"", 215 Lbs. I have 32"" inseam and a 36"" waist, the large fit as expected. They are great lounge around the house in slippers pants. This is my third pair and I will keep buying them as long as they keep making them."
5.0,Fit well soft comfortable I‚Äôm short 5feet ordered large and the length isgood but I like like longer. So probably perfect for a slightly taller person. Comfortable fit in waist and with arthritis pulls up easy.
5.0,"Comfy I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3 and 125 lbs. I love the material, really comfy. The length fits me well just like how I want it to be. I prefer it to be loose so M is a good choice for me. However, the waist is still too big for me and I need to alter it later. Take S if you don‚Äôt want it to be loose."
5.0,"Everything to love This pants are so soft and such a lovely slimming fit! Love them! I am considered somewhat of a tall petite with an inseam of 30. These (after washing) didn't shrink at all and the inseam just touches the ground making it a 31 - which is perfect for short ladies! The price can't be beat! I am a curvy lady and felt like these were made for me! The waist is a no fuss! Love, love, love them!!!"
5.0,"swea-lacks These pants in dark are wonderful! I pair them with a shirt and cardigan for my zoom calls, if I have to get up during the call.. the dark pair just look like dark slacks!!! Super great for chasing a 3 year old while holding a baby!"
5.0,Works for me Like the pants. Fits me well in size medium. Large was too big!  Have washed and dried twice so far  and holds it shape. I am 5‚Äô7 inches and between 160-165 lbs.
5.0,"Soft and cuddly My body size is a 1x or 2x depending on material. I ordered a 2x and they were too big in the waist and legs. I returned them and got an extra large they fit perfect in the legs.However,the bottom of the pants are wide legged. I like straight leg so I'm just going to make it straight leg myself. As for putting them in the dryer I dont know if they will shrink. So seeing that I bought 2 pair I'll try only one pair in the dryer."
5.0,"These run super large! Super cozy, though. Super, super soft both on the inside and the outside (though the inside is still a lot softer, furry almost). True to color on site (I got the lighter grey) and obviously a quality material and make. The only problem is that they are HUGE! I like to wear pajama bottoms in something between an XL-XXL. I ordered the XL and they‚Äôre just way too big. They nearly slip off my hips! I ordered a second pair in the L. I‚Äôll update after they arrive!"
5.0,"Cozy and comfortable These are incredibly soft and comfortable. Listened to the reviews and sized down to a medium instead of my regular large. They are a perfect fit!! Well, they are a bit long, but I'm short so I would guess they would fit an average sized person better in the length. They are a more fitted ""boot cut"" or yoga pant style, not super baggy in the hip and thigh area. They're cozy  and actually sort of feminine for sweats!"
5.0,Comfortable and fits. These are an excellent pair of casual sweats to wear when I just want to get errands done on the weekend and just to wear around the house.The length is perfect for me in the petite (I am 5‚Äô3). They hit just below my ankles and are not thick so they pretty much can be worn year round were I live.
5.0,"Comfortable but short These are normal sweats, but run VERY short.  I'm 5' 7"" and 150lbs, they come above my ankle by at least 2 inches. Other than being too short, they fit great at waist, and throughout the legs. Would work for someone maybe 5' 3"""
5.0,"BEST SWEATS EVER First,  they run a little big, so I sized down and they fit perfect.  Nothing is ever long enough on me and again, they are perfect.  I love these.  It‚Äôs a medium weight, so I‚Äôm not sweating, and because they don‚Äôt have pockets, they lay nicely, almost dressy, if sweats could be dressy!  The price:  $7.50.  I couldn‚Äôt believe it.  I have two pair, and want them all.  A real bargain, all around."
5.0,"Warning:  Different Lengths for Same Size For the price, these sweats are awesome!  Two pairs arrived at the same time.  I tried them on after washing/drying and had to shorten both the same.  When the third pair arrived I assumed they were the same length as the others and shortened them accordingly.  Now they were too short!  Fortunately it was easy to just remove the stitching and they are just fine.  Hope this will be helpful."
5.0,cozy pants for inside the house Wanted something loose fit but not too big.  These pants fit me just right in all the right places.  Comfy pants.
5.0,"Warm straight leg pants Ordered large size.  5‚Äô4‚Äù 165 lbs.  good fit around, but an inch too long.  I think it was listed in size at 31 inches long.  Did not see option for ordering petite length.  No pockets which I am happy with for straight fit.  Nice pants for everyday wear.  I don‚Äôt think of them as sweatpants.  Color was a dark grey/blue.  Washed well in cold water with no shrinkage or fading."
5.0,"comfortable I love these sweats. The weight is perfect, not too heavy, not too light. I ordered one pair to be sure of the fit. I'm ordering 2 more pair. I ordered medium, I'm 5ft 5in. and weight 145, the fit is perfect."
5.0,"Comfy, soft, easy care, and very reasonably priced Like these so well I bought a second pair! They‚Äôre comfortable, just the right length (the pants hem brushes the top of my foot), have a wide, stretchy waistband for a no-tug-but-still-snug fit and the rise is high enough to stay up dependably but not so high they look ‚Äúgrandmotherly.‚Äù Plus, they come out of the dryer looking like they‚Äôve been ironed. As someone who despises ironing, I give them *extra points* for that!"
5.0,"Thick but lightweight material. Good/loose fitting. I liked everything about these pants. They are thick but not heavy so I will keep them for my fall/ winter wardrobe. I have a small waist, large booty and long waisted. Is difficult to find this kind of pant that fits without being too tight on the leg as well. These score five stars in every way."
5.0,"So soft and comfy, but buy a size smaller These sweatpants run a size big, just FYI! I'm a M/L on sweats so I can have a comfy fit, but ended up buying a small in these. The M was huge but the small was perfect. They are SO SOFT and cozy! And they can either be big and comfy or more fitted but still not tight like yoga pants. Great value for the price. I've washed and dried them and no shrinkage either. Love them!"
5.0,"Very Comfy - great quality I really enjoy wearing these sweat pants. They are very comfy and soft, also great quality, especially for the price, perfect for laying around the house, even wearing out for casual wear. I chose a size Medium, and they fit great, not skin tight (exaclty what I was looking for). I would say they run a LITTLE on the big side but nothing to crazy. I would suggest washing them inside out before wearing them."
5.0,Fitted sweats I like the price and the comfort. The waist band is wide enough to hide a little belly but not too tight to be uncomfortable. The fabric is thicker than fleece leggings but not as bulky as regular sweats.I got these on an amazing deal. I think less than $10 and I think if I paid more than $15 I'd be less thrilled with them.Overall üëç
5.0,"I Live in These I work from home, so these are my ""go to"" clothes most every day. The 31"" inseam is good for me and the fit is loose enough to tuck into if you wear layers as I do. Minimal pilling and no shrinkage that I noticed."
5.0,"Comfy sweats Just what I was looking for! I looked for just a basic sweat pants and couldn‚Äôt find anything gave it a shot and tried these,To my surprise they are basic sweats again just what I was looking for. They do run slightly big I ordered a large normally an extra large and I could‚Äôve Got away with a medium. I am very pleased and they are perfectly comfortable!"
5.0,"Great for women too Although advertised as a men‚Äôs product, it's great for women too. I‚Äôm tired of paying the pink tax for things like sweatpants and these work great. They sit comfortably on the waist, like mid-rise pants. I got these to wear over thin hospital scrubs when walking outside in the snow and cold. They did not shed or pill. Very good at keeping warmth and also super soft!"
5.0,"Super comfy I love these pants so much I've gotten three pairs. They're comfortable, they're warm but not too warm and they fit me very well (I'm 5'3 and most pants are too long). I've been primarily using them for sleep pants but they'd be good for lounging or quick errands or whatever. Personally, I think they'd be too warm for actual sweatpants use like exercise but that's just my opinion."
5.0,"Soft and comfortable sweat pants. These sweatpants  were just right. I'm a size 12. I ordered L. They are loose and nice and soft and comfortable. I double roll up a hem on the bottom, because I am short @ 5'1"", but it would be easy to cut or sew them up.I have been sleeping in them like pj bottoms. Perfect for hanging around. I like them a lot."
5.0,"Can't miss for the price I had a pair from about 10 years ago that were too big.  I loved how soft they felt and held up.  I bought a smaller size (L instead of XL) and they run as expected.  I thought they'd be too small but they stretch.  I could use them a little bigger in the waist and a little longer (I'm 5'9"") but I'm very happy with them....especially at this low price."
5.0,"GREAT pants! I loved finding these on sale to wear at home or to bed! I can even wear them out if I wanted. They fit well, even though I am losing weight and they are getting kinda big on me. I bought 2 pairs and they are very comfortable. I have machine washed them and hung to dry to make them last as long as possible without getting rough on the inside and so far so good! VERY COMFORTABLE! Great for inside, whether cold out and the heat is on, or hot out and air conditioning is on. Very happy!"
5.0,Love these I love the fit. Loose but not overly baggy. I wear these pants above my waist. The run long but not to where I‚Äôm stepping on the legs as I walk. Would recommend and buy again
5.0,"Perfect sweatpants These pants are not for fashion. They do not fit in a way that will make your butt look good or anything flattering like that, but they are SO comfortable. These are my period pants. I love them."
5.0,Comfy big Feels very soft but they do fall big waist wise so don't feel you need to up the size. They stretch pretty good. I'm short so length wise it goes past my ankle but if you are tall they should be just right.
5.0,"Comfortable but run big I really like these, I actually ordered a second pair after trying them out. They run big, like my guess is order a size down? I think I am about a 22 in pants right now and the XL size fits perfectly straight out of the dryer and then sags a bit after wearing for a while. The price is right though and they are very comfortable so I would even consider ordering a third pair for winter time."
5.0,"LOVE these pants !! At $7.50 I was a little skeptical about these pants but I am SO happy that I ordered them, they are the most comfortable pants I have ever wore & I went back and ordered 4 more pair today LOL I just had a little one on Sept 17 so I'm all about comfort right now and honestly these are perfect. Not to mention they arrived in 2 days even without having prime shipping. 5 stars, great guy !! :)"
5.0,Sizing not consistent but worth the try I am over 70 and consider myself active. I bought a black pair and a heather blue pair both in medium. The blue fit perfectly for me. The black was too short. I exchanged the black for a large which is a little too big In the waste but was long enough. They‚Äôre both very comfortable. I washed warm water and just dried enough to shake our the wrinkles and did not have any shrinkage. I would buy these again.
5.0,"Comfy, warm, nice looking, and fit well - what more do you want? I got these b/c I had just had surgery and couldn't wear regular pants yet.  I didn't realize that I didn't really have ANY sweats, and even very few comfy pants with an elastic waist.  These fit the bill.  They are also nice enough to wear out for casual occasions.  Decent quality, and nice and warm, and they fit well.  I'm tall-ish (5' 7""), and it's often hard to find things that fit right.  Tall is usually too long, and average or regular is usually too short.  It's annoying.  Anyway, when I first got these, I was concerned that they might shrink when washed, but they didn't; they fit perfectly even after several washes - they come out the same size, still looking like new."
5.0,"Great sweatpant! I am very pleased with this purchase.  I usually wear a large or sometimes even an extra large as I don't like sweat pants to fit too snugly.  After reading the reviews about sizing, I ordered a medium and they were still a little bit large.  However, a run in the dryer made them just right.  The waist sits low on these, below the naval."
5.0,"Function over Fabulous These are very loose and comfortable ‚Äúhouse pants‚Äù.I needed loose fitting pants that are easy to put on and take off for a hip replacement. I purchased two pairs. These were perfect winter pants. Just be forewarned, they really don‚Äôt have a shape or style but they are very warm and comfortable.They shrank a little after I washed them in cold water but it was okay for me given how I used them."
5.0,"Love These Sweatpants! Because the price was SO good, and they are Hanes, I went ahead and purchased three pairs in different colors.I LOVE them.  They fit and are made well.  The ad said I could order in Petite length, but I never could figure out how.So, just a tad long for me as I'm short.Highly recommend.  Great product for a great price."
5.0,"I‚Äôm 5,9‚Äù tall and the length is perfect Liked the fit and they were lightweight"
5.0,Medium to heavy weight fleece. Heavyweight low rise fleece workout pants.
5.0,Very cozy and comfortable All of the pants were too long when I received them (have all colors but purple & pink) ~Washed in warm water & tumbled dry on warm setting ~ they now fit perfectly!!Sit right on top of sneakers with a little bend ~(They are 50%/50% so I hoped for the shrinkage in length ~ rest of pant did not shrink)I'm 5'3 ~ 113 lbs. wearing size Small ~
5.0,Great sweats I always get Hanes  sweatpants. How can you go wrong with hanes. They are my go to sweats for just chilling in the house. And they are so affordable.
5.0,"I found my sweatpants! I was looking for a standard pair of sweatpants. I feel like all I could find in stores was super tight workout pants, or summer weight pants or pants I would not call comfortable.  These are the pants I was looking for!! The are warm and soft, they are not form fitting, but not super sloppy either. They are wide at the ankle. And they are super reasonably priced!"
5.0,Perfect I‚Äôm petite.  Easy to shorten.  Very comfortable for cold weather.
5.0,"My go to winter pants I work from home and it gets cold in my office. So I decided to wear a uniform every day and I wear these sweatpants with a different top every day. They keep my legs warm and they are extremely comfortable.  Walmart used to carry them but they don't anymore, so thankfully I can get them on Amazon."
5.0,"RICO,  PARA LOS QUE LE GUSTA CHOCOLATE NEGRO me agrado"
5.0,"Great product, great quality I‚Äôve now ordered 3 pairs of these sweats to make my postpartum attire more comfortable. Soft and they fit just right with a 9 months belly, so I expect them to be quite perfect over the next couple weeks. They didn‚Äôt shrink in the wash. I ordered a pair and was sent a sweatshirt instead and was promptly sent out the correct item. Can‚Äôt beat the price! Only bummer is no pockets, but whatever. These are perfect!"
5.0,"Perfect mom style sweats These sweatpants are perfect for doing mommy related tasks such as driving a minivan and putting chicken nuggets in the oven. They are well made, super comfortable, warm, and not completely terrible looking. I especially like the middle rise cut around the waist. You can bend over without showing your embarrassing mom underwear. They are loose through the leg without being bulky. I can see where some people might think they are too long, but I think this is great because I can throw them in the washer and it's no big deal if they shrink a little. I'm 5'6"" and ordered a size large and they hit below my ankles like in the picture. I'll definitely be ordering a few more pairs."
5.0,Comfort and great value. Bought these to wear after back surgery. They are basic comfortable and affordable. You can't go wrong with Hanes. Love them. True to size.
5.0,"Nice sweats! Much bigger than I thought but I am happy with them.  For a small, the waist was quite big.  Fits more like a medium.  As I am using them as house pants they worked for my needs.  They are quite long and I was very glad to see that.  I hate purchasing a pair of sweats or PJ's just to have them shrink up past your ankles the first wash.  I'd buy again if they come out with more colors."
5.0,"Comfortable, not sloppy, perfect fit, no pockets I wanted comfy sweatpants that still looked/fit decently so I could work from home and feel comfortable but not feel like a slob. üòÜ These fit the bill! I wish they had pockets but that‚Äôs about my only complaint. Very comfortable, the length is perfect, and the fit at the top is good - not too tight or loose. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6‚Äù and wear a US size 10 and got the M in these."
5.0,Soft and comfortable Fits perfect!  Soft and comfortable
5.0,"very comfy These sweats are very comfortable and fit great. I am 5'7"", 150lbs and ordered the S. It fits perfect and I looked at other reviews on sizing so be sure to order a size down. The length is great for me as I don't like my sweats to be too short. Have washed and dried and they came out like new."
5.0,Pleasantly surprised I don‚Äôt know why but I was expecting different like I think bad quality because I got them for 5$ but they are easy to throw on and comfy and I don‚Äôt mind running somewhere in them if I have too. They are a little loose on me but they don‚Äôt look baggy due to the cut. Warmer workout outfit perfect for right now
5.0,"Exactly what I needed... I ordered these in a couple different colors because I needed some new pajama pants.When I first opened these, I thought they were going to be too heavy to wear to bed, but after wearing them a few times - I am in love. I tend to sweat when I sleep, but not with these and I don't know if it's the fabric or what, but this is warm AND breathable."
5.0,"Good purchase This is a loose fit in the crouch area.  Im 5'8"".  I wish they were an inch longer.  I wear an exlarge.  I did go a size down to a large from the reviews. They do run a little big.  Fits my purpose. Loose,  for Physical Therapy sessions, and comfortable too. They feel very soft."
5.0,Love these pants I have several pairs and wear them nearly every day.  So easy care just wash and dry. No knee bagging like most of products like this.  So comfortable.
5.0,No ankle elastic...comfy! Very comfy and loose. . Love that the legs are loose and no elastic around ankles! Perfect blend of sweatpants feel but no tight ankle issue and look nicer. I got an XL and probably could have got a L..maybe they run slightly large. But have not yet washed them...perhaps will shrink a bit do to cotton content..I think they will be great. The only thing I‚Äôd have added...pockets! Always pockets.
5.0,"Make certain to buy long or petite length I am really bummed that I neglected to order petite length - I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2‚Äù.  The long size which it defaults to, is about 3‚Äù too long and drags on the floor and under shoes.  Otherwise, they‚Äôre great.  Thickness is perfect, the material is soft and sturdy in appearance and the waist was not too snug.  I‚Äôve had to return it and will purchase the petite length."
5.0,"Very soft Love these pants, got 2 pairs.  Perfect for lounging, very soft and warm.  They seem to run large since I normally wear a medium, but based on reviews I got the small, and they fit perfectly in the waist and lengthwise.  I am 5'6'', about 140 lbs, larger in the hips.  Someone said they get fuzz all over when washed, but I didn't have that issue."
5.0,"Great price, solid quality, do run big. As people suggested, I ordered one size smaller than I would have and they fit perfectly.  They seemed a bit snug after washing and drying, but quickly stretched back to the right size after I put them on and moved around a little.  Length seemed a tad long at first, but they shrunk up just enough to be just right on me.  (I tumble-dried on low heat.)  I'm 5'3"" so if you are 5'5"" or taller, these would probably end up being a little too short on you.  I'm giving the pants five stars not because they are the greatest sweatpants ever, but because they're just fine, just what I needed, and for the price, they are wonderful."
5.0,"Nice and comfy I just received my pants and very happy about the outcome. After reading some reviews about sizing problems, I was hesitant if I should order them. Normally, I'm a medium (5'4, 135 lbs) but I decided to order a small instead. They actually fit perfect and they are very comfy. The material is a little thicker but not to warm. I will order a second pair."
5.0,"Sweats for a decent quality at a bargain price How much complaining can anyone do when a pair of soft, relatively comfortable, sweats are under $10. Would I like to have pockets? You bet! But for the cost, these will do the job. They've been through the wash twice and held together without leaving a trail of dye. They haven't shrunk to fit a toddler. I'd say these are a rare find."
5.0,Only elastic at waistline; no tie or 'belt' Nice pair of sweats and very comfortable. Was glad they were long enough. What Hanes should do is put in some kind of cloth belt so the waist can be tightened when necessary. Otherwise a good purchase.
5.0,"Perfect Sweatpants but Order a Size Smaller I love these sweatpants! So soft and comfortable! Perfect length for me as I wear pants right at my belly button and they hang right below my ankles. Definitely order a size down. Many reviews suggested the pants were sized too big. Normally I'd buy a 2XL but because of the reviews, I ordered an XL and they are the perfect fit for me. I bought black and grey but for the price, I may buy a couple more. Thanks for a great product!"
5.0,"Great pants, will but more I purchased these pants based on previous reviews.  Wow, I am glad I did.  These are so comfortable.  I plan to purchase other colors.  They fit well, are very comfortable.  My only complaint is that they don‚Äôt have pockets.  I am 5-9, I got the xl and they fit great.  I am very happy with my purchase."
5.0,"Great value and as expected. I am 5'3"" 112 lbs and bought a small. Waist is loose but doesn't fall down or bother me at all. The length is fine and covers my ankles. These are perfect pants for around the house. I have washed them several times and still have a very soft comfy feel. Little to none shrinkage. Not super stylish but perfect for my needs."
5.0,"Very comfy and a great deal These are great lounging pants. I've bought these for years at the store and was happy to see them on Amazon. They run a tad large in the waist, but they are a looser fit so that's to be expected. I'm 5'6"", size 10/12, and I ordered L because I like them roomy to cover my legs and back side. I tend to sleep in these as well, so I can roll out of bed and walk the dog on cold mornings. Highly recommend, especially for the price. I've already washed these a few times and they are holding up well. I have a few pairs that I bought years ago and they are still going strong."
5.0,"Love them! Perfect sweatpants, perfect fit This is an awesome pair of  sweatpants. I got the black, tried them on, and immediately ordered the grey. I can sleep in them and drive the kids to school in my ‚Äúpajamas‚Äù. I wear them to the store, gym, anywhere. The fit is perfect (I‚Äôm a 6 and ordered the small, expecting that they would be too small. They are the perfect size even after repeated washings and dryings on high heat). If you‚Äôre looking for an old school pair of sweatpants that has a straight leg, isn‚Äôt bulky, is warm yet breathes, and isn‚Äôt as figure hugging as yoga pants, these pants are for you."
5.0,"The Perfect WFH Pants!!! Love these sweatpants! They are sooo soft and fit as nicely as expensive athleisure wear. The waistband is wide and stretchy and the cut nice enough to wear out on errands, etc. They're perfect for WFH where you want something comfortable, but don't want to feel sloppy and unprofessional. I'm a 12 and the size L fit perfectly. So far they haven't shrunk in the washer/dryer and the lining remains soft and cozy. Already ordered a second pair and maybe I'll even order a third!"
5.0,"Heavy Sweats These are made with a heavier sweat pant material so make sure you are looking for a warmer type pant. You wouldn't want to wear these in warm weather, but are rather perfect for those cooler days.  They fit perfect and don't have that annoying tie at the waist.  No elastic at the ankle either.  These are good, old-fashioned comfortable sweat pants."
5.0,Comfortable These are very comfortable and nice for the price. The leg is a little short I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2‚Äù and they hit right at the ankle. I like to have one slightly longer but hint cant complain too much since they are just for house wear. I got an extra large normally I wear a size 14. They just fit I would hate for them to be any tighter. The fabric is soft and comfortable. I would probably purchase them again.
5.0,"Very comfortable! I enjoy wearing these pants at home. However, they can be worn outside the home for errands. The XL fit me nicely. I usually wear a 16 or 18 in pants. (If there is a generous cut in the thighs, I can wear a 16.)"
5.0,"Runs large but my FAVE and most economic sweats available!! These run VERY big, go down a size or even two.. I'm an XL, (gained 30 lbs since COVID started and am totally an XL now) but the XLs were waaay too big and the larges are a bit big after a few days as well. Trying out a medium after Christmas... These sweats are SOOOO comfy once you figure out the right size!"
5.0,"Buy a size smaller than you usually wear I have purchased Hanes brand sweat pants at Walmart.  Always got a L.  This time the L fits my husband.  I re-ordered a medium but still had to hem them two inches.  I'm 5'4"".  They are warm & will be perfect to lounge around in or run errands.  Just make sure you get a size smaller than usual."
5.0,Good quality These pants were very long.
5.0,"Runs large I read the reviews and ordered two sizes down (I'm usually a large (size 7-8) in pants, but I ordered a small) and they fit great! If you're ~5'6"" and ~140lbs, I recommend ordering a small :)"
5.0,Comfy Ok so it‚Äôs distance learning time and I have 3 in school and a 2 year old. I wanted something that was comfortable to wear around the house during this crazy time. When I first received these pants they looked huge. I washed and dried them. They are a little big but I love them. I ordered 2 more. They are perfect for this mom of 4.I ordered a small.
5.0,BEWARE THEY RUN BIG BEWAREEE they run big I‚Äôm usually a large bc of my hips and butt but I should‚Äôve gotten a medium
5.0,True to fit! I bought these for my niece and she lives them. They fit perfectly and wash up great.
5.0,Very comfortable Great price and durable.
5.0,"Feel nice, but definitely large I just received these and they feel nice with a soft inside. As everybody else says, they definitely run large. I am 5‚Äô10‚Äù 165 lbs and wear a size 10, I ordered a medium and it‚Äôs still roomy. The waist feels comfortable but the legs and butt are too loose. I‚Äôm keeping them because they were going to be lounge/pajama pants anyways, but they are definitely loose."
5.0,"Great deal For at-home daily wear in the fall and winter when you're not expecting company, these are great. They're very long on me but I am small. I imagine for a woman of average height, they might be slightly long or just right.  However, they seem to be made well and are very warm and comfortable. You certainly won't find any equal or better at a comparable price."
5.0,"Soft, warm, comfy, and attractive! I love that the garment is made with partly recycled plastic. The pants look nice and I wear them to work, with a pretty pullover sweater."
5.0,Comfortable Comfortable and casual pant. Well fitted to wear for multiple occassions.  May need to order a size below.  No pockets and petite wording in description is incorrect.  Excellent pant style.
5.0,"Nice Warm Sweatpants However, the listing on your web site says they ARE AVAILABLE IN PETITE AND REGULAR LENGTH, BUT WHEN ORDERING THERE ISN'T A PLACE TO SELECT WHICH ONE YOU WANT.  My last order was made for Petitte but they came in Regular.  Way Too Long for my friend or for me.  I'm returning both pairs."
5.0,"Hanes casual pants Pants are very comfortable, well made and a good value.  I bought them to wear at home through the day.  I bought a navy and black pair.  Will definitely buy a couple more pair before winter."
5.0,"Runs larger than normal. The pants are great, they just run very large.  I normally wear an XL and the pants were very loose.  I‚Äôm not sending them back as it‚Äôs cold, I have a lot of layers tucked into them and I need them, but I will order a L and I think those will fit better."
5.0,Great fit and quality Comfort level is excellent
5.0,"Size Down! I bought the first pair using the Amazon try-on at home wardrobe program. Glad I did that. I followed previous reviewers advice and sized down one size. The pants fit perfectly and I went back and got two more, in different colors. Very happy with my purchases. Just remember to size down one size!"
5.0,Great Find I love these pants. They fit just right and are very comfortable. I bought the top to match. It is a medium material but good for fall and under my heated through while watching movies or around the house.
5.0,"very comfortable, fits well I use this product for gym class as well as just casual wear.  It's not a summer pant, more for cool weather"
5.0,"Very Comfortable Pant These pants are very comfy.  No worries, they do not include a waist tie, they just fit.  Semi-wide waste band, not to much, just enough to make these pants look as comfortable as they feel.  No regrets with these pants, they are insulated (soft and warm on the inside), I have six pairs, one of each I wear to work (warehouse) daily."
5.0,"Amazing pants, size down These sweatpants are amazing for the price! I wish they had pockets, but there are so many great things about these pants. Definitely size down, I am a curvy girl with a big butt and thighs, about 177lbs and 5‚Äô4‚Äù in height and a medium fits me perfectly. The inside is so soft, and I can‚Äôt believe the quality for the price! I will be purchasing more"
5.0,"Great product outstanding quality! I always wash my items before I buy them. Because of covid-19, I washed them and drive them and very hot temperatures. The color was maintained and the product did not shrink. The product was of excellent quality. The price was right. My mother and sister saw them and asked me to order two pair each for them and I ordered another one for me and another color. True to Hanes quality!"
5.0,Overall Great Most comfortable pants ever
5.0,"Too short They are a nice fabric for the cost.  Although I ordered what I thought was a regular size, but got shipped petite.  I'm 5'7"" and after washing they are just too short."
5.0,Comfort They are very comfortable and fit nice I am 5‚Äô10‚Äù I wish they were a little longer.
5.0,"Comfy, nice waist band and has pockets! Very nice and comfy. Seems to run a little big. I was worried the large would be a little tight so I got the xl figuring they would shrink in the dryer. But they are still a bit big. Next time I will get the large. But they are comfy and a nice thickness. Not too thick, not too thin."
5.0,Soft material These were purchased for my mother
5.0,Warm and comfortable pants Very comfortable and kinda loose fitting which is great for a change of style for me. Nice and warm and perfect for the winter season we‚Äôre in right now. Washes well and I just hang to  dry. I like the fit so I don‚Äôt want to put it in the dryer. I‚Äôm happy with my purchase.
5.0,"Love the pants I really love this pants, they are so comfortable and warm and will be ordering 2 more again."
5.0,"Great Bang For Your Buck! I love the Hanes brand! I don't require that $78 sweats buisness, give me the real deal. I'm 5'5 236 and I ordered an XL in blue and they fit perfectly. The length sits right below the ankle and the waist right at the belly button. Roomy, comfortable and easy on the wallet."
5.0,"Too good to be true! Love these sweat pants. My oldest sweat pants were looking very sad so I thought I would update my COVID wardrobe!  I bought two pairs because the price was so good. Very comfy,but don‚Äôt look like typical sweatpants. I would definitely wear them out. They do run big so go down a size!"
5.0,"Great cheap sweatpants For $6, I couldn't be happier - unless they had pockets. But they are very comfortable, simple pants. Warm enough for cool evenings. Haven't worn them in cold weather yet.Buying sweatpants for walking the dog this Covid winter. Not sure if I'll be able to go back to work pants when this is over!"
5.0,"Runs Very Large I bought these in gray and black. Both fit larger. The gray pair were moderately larger and the black pair just way to big. I bought a size small and am normally a size 4 in most pants. I was swimming in the black ones, they wouldn‚Äôt even stay on my hips."
5.0,Very comfy pants! Pants are super comfortable and made well; they do run big...sometimes I go 2 sizes up when I order online but this time I overdid it....got a 2xl which was wayyyyy to big...so I got a large instead...perfect fit thru waist and size but the bottom flares out like an oversized boot cut fit....
5.0,"To big (Barry‚Äôs wife)I am thick ordered an extra large thinking they will fit just right but they are actually two big,made me feel good but at the same time I‚Äôm stuck with large pair of pants that I have to roll up at the waist but they let me keep them and they refunded my money I‚Äôm happy about it I was more than willing to exchange them!"
5.0,"Loose, soft and comfy These are the most soft and comfortable sweatpants. I ordered 4 of them because I‚Äôm getting ready to have a knee replacement and wanted something loose, soft and comfy to wear around the house. They fill the bill for sure. My only problem is that they are so long, but I‚Äôm only 5‚Äô3‚Äù and there was no size XS, but I expected that."
5.0,"Good for price Great price.  I like the way they fit but they are very long.  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8‚Äù and had to roll them up otherwise they would drag on the floor.  I have a smaller waistline for my size so they fall lower on my hips as well.  However, I like that these sweats have enough room in the right places to not accentuate any bulges yet don‚Äôt look frumpy."
5.0,Great lounging pants Ordered the medium and I usually wear a large and it fits perfectly. 5‚Äô 7‚Äù 140 lbs. I washed them when I received them and after the first time wearing them I had black fuzzies all over myself. After the second washing the fuzzies were nit as bad. They are soft and comfortable. Can‚Äôt beat the price.
5.0,"My umpteenth pair | Size runs LARGE PRO:-I LOVE these pants and have been wearing them, as warm pants for inside, during the cold winters in the Northeast!-They are made of both COTTON and stretchy SPANDEX.  (This material is my favorite, as in time they relax and become super comfy!)NOTE: They do run LARGE, so be sure to order down 1 size.CONCLUSION = I use to purchase these, from a local big box store, however they stopped carrying them and so I hope I can buy more here, in the future!"
5.0,Sizes are not correct I ordered  the large first which was too big then I ordered a medium (which says runs big) but they were way too small and very short
5.0,"Comfortable I purposely purchased an XL because I thought these would shrink a bit.  They did not shrink.  If I purchase again I will purchase a L.  However, even though they are loose on me (my fault for ordering an XL), they are still extremely comfortable.  I will purchase another pair!"
5.0,"Good Product I'm a 60+-year-old woman who loves these sweatpants very much. It's very comfortable, I will recommend it."
5.0,Bought for comfort I wanted these to keep me warm but be comfortable enough to work on the farm in and they are perfect.  I bought a size up thinking they might shrink but they didn‚Äôt.  Only thing that could improve them is a draw string but it‚Äôs not a deal breaker for the price.
5.0,Very comfy  Not for gym use since there is no drawstring to hold waist  in place Love the fit  Actually enhances your shape.  At first glance you would never expect  them to fit like that  When opened up they looked like oversized baggy pants.  Even my grand kids were surprised by  the fit
5.0,Order a size a little larger than you normally wear I ordered the size that I normally wear and they were a little small so make sure you order a size larger than normal. The pants are thinner than normal sweatpants which I actually like because they aren't as hot.
5.0,"Wife is only 4'10"" Good buy Easy on and off for handicapped person. 2"" too long for a short person but do the job really well. I have ordered more"
5.0,Love the color. Photo does not give iit justice Love the texture. Very surprised st how great they look!
5.0,Love these Even though these pants are to big on me I never want to take them off..I love them very comfortable..I will be ordering a size or two smaller..I'm typically a size 13 or 14 in jeans so I orderd a large..I could definitely go for a small or medium ..but they are definitely worth the price
5.0,Excellent fit & comfortable Fits just as I needed.  Would recommend for comfort & fit
5.0,Comfortable It's fits comfortable.  I have a problem with holding water and swelling so finding something that is comfortable is a most
5.0,"Calidad precio Excelente producto para el costo, comodo y durable"
5.0,So happy it's not petite I just had a pancreas and kidney transplant. Esteroides has made me gain weight so I had no pants. I ordered these pants open but they would fit correctly and not be tight around the stomach but I have my incision. It's perfect it's comfortable and most importantly it's warm. I loved it so much I ordered two more pair
5.0,Very comfortable Very comfortable. A bit long as I‚Äôm only 5‚Äô . Quality is good and the price is worth the purchase!
5.0,"Soooo Comfy These are one the most comfortable pairs of comfy pants I own.  I purchased them for working out. After wearing them the first time, they were immediately renamed comfy pants and a second pair was ordered.  The fabric is baby soft inside and just thick enough without being bulky.  The waist band fits gently yet still stays in place. I have a 31.5"" inseam and the length after washing is perfect (less than 1/2"" from floor barefooted) . As expected, the length did shrink a bit with wash/dry."
5.0,"Comfortable.  Easy wash and wear. Pants are a little longer that I wanted, but otherwise they fit great."
5.0,"Good value The fit is very good, waist is loose fitting but stays in place, very nice length for me at 5'7"".The have been laundered a few times, no shrinkage or pulling of the fabric, and they are medium weight fabric. Comfortable."
5.0,"SO Soft and Comfortable! I love sweat pants to relax in, and my old ones were finally  getting threadbare.  I tried one pair of these and loved them so much that I ordered two more!  They are so soft and comfortable, they feel like ""air"".  The fit isn't too loose, they stay up without a tie at the waist, and they are long enough to touch my shoe tops, which is what I like."
5.0,Good standard sweatpant Very comfy. Very soft material.
5.0,"Work pants Just right to work the yard in, I (sewed in)my own pockets and put in a draw string in myself"
5.0,"Wish they came in xxs-xs. Nice sweat pants BUT run huge. I ordered the small petite, they were several inches too long & 2 sizes too big. Unfortunately they have xs petite but not on this site. Im 5‚Äô3‚Äù & 109lbs. Hope this helps."
5.0,"Quality not as good as in previous purchases. These were too loose in the waist and hips. Also, the quality of the fabric is very inferior to previous purchases."
5.0,"Great pants I love these pants. Many reviews said that the pants were way too large. I found that they fit me just right. I am 5'3"" 180 pounds and the large size is perfect for me. They wash well too with hardly any shrinkage. I found that they do pill a little where my thighs rub together but that's not a big deal to me since I only paid a little over $7.00 a pair."
5.0,Comfy pants to lounge in! Very comfortable for lounging around the house; I got the XL and they are a bit loose in the waist but I didn't want to go any smaller and have them not fit my hips.  I have now ordered them in 3 colors and am very happy with the overall product and the Price was great!
5.0,"Like a cross between yoga pants and sweats.  Shrunk back to right size. I ordered based on the size chart, which directed my normal size.  Upon arrival they were a bit roomy in the waist and a bit long, but after being washed they fit perfectly.  Mine shrunk both in the width and in the length.  These are great, not too heavy not too light.  Heavier than yoga pants, lighter than thick quality sweats."
5.0,"Too short Too short for me. 32‚Äù inseam would be fine but these are closer to 29 or 30‚Äù. I ordered a larger size to make sure they would be long enough, they were not."
5.0,"Comfortable SweatPants My mother loves these sweatpants. She says they are so comfortable.  The only thing is getting the size right. If you are a medium you might wanna go a size smaller Seems like they run a little big Or their sizing chart is off. But I would recommend, my mother has bought 3 pairs so far."
5.0,"Soooooo Comfy These are so comfortable! I think I bought a medium (I‚Äôd double check but I‚Äôm wearing them and am too lazy at the moment to bother checking) and could have gone a size smaller, but they fit pretty good loose anyway. I feel compelled to buy more in different colors..."
5.0,Very comfortable These sweats are very comfortable and fit on the loose side. Soft and wash well.
5.0,"Perfect in every way I'm wearing a pair of these as I write this, and I've never been more comfortable. Not too heavy, not too light, fit just right! I bought three pair in different colors. Most likely I'll wear them all winter. They look smooth on, as well--not bunchy like so many other sweat pants. A great pant!"
5.0,"Comfortable and holding up nicely Soft, comfy, and long enough.  It's hard to find pants long enough w/o being too long.  These fit the bill.  I've washed them several times, and they are holding up great - no significant fading or shrinking.  If I need more sweat pants, I will probably get these again.  I got these originally after having surgery so that I had something soft and stretchy to wear when I was extremely sore.  They were terrific for that, and I continue to wear them for casual or just around the house.  This is a purchase I am pleased that I made."
5.0,Good sweatpants. Good exercise pant. Good on cold days.
5.0,"Warm & cozy I purchased three pair, black, blue & grey. All were too long for my 5'2"" body, so I inserted elastic into the bottom hem of each and was very pleased with the fitted bottom results. (Will post same review for each pair.) They were very cozy on snowy evenings."
5.0,"Great Buy Love the fit and they look great.  Perfect length (5'9"") and fit in the waist. Wonderful for outside walk in the cooler weather. Price is exceptionally good.  Only wish is that they had pockets but at this price, I knew what I was getting.Nice weight fabric for cool weather in Florida winters."
5.0,They are very nice. I have to wear braces on legs. They are nice enough for church.
5.0,"So very comfortable During the COVID19 Quarantine, I'm wearing nighttime pajamas and daytime pajamas.  These pants are now part of my daytime uniform.They're soft, forgiving, and I can make a run to the store in them without feeling like a total slob.They launder well, and I'm so stinking grateful they‚Äôre in my life!"
5.0,"ORDER A SMALL SIZE! This is my 2nd time ordering these. The 1st order, i ordered large, which is what i normally wear, and they where huge. I figured it was easier just to keep them and order another pair in a smaller size, so i ordered Medium. They still fit loosely, so definately order a smaller size."
5.0,"price fit my budget the price was great . i ordered a size smaller after reading the reviews at  first seemed tight but after wearing a little bit were fine , i am short and they are alittle long but overall am very happy with them nice and soft and warm and comfy."
5.0,Fit is perfect Like color shape sizeGood value
5.0,Comfy! Good lightweight sweat pants. I usually wear size 10 and the small is perfect.
5.0,Fit was true I bought these pants for my mother who is in a wheelchair and lives in a Long Term Care Facility.  They fit her very well.  The length was not really an issue since she is in a wheelchair.  She likes them because they feel soft.
5.0,"Great knock around sweats! I ordered 4 pair when I fractured my ankle and anything fitted around the ankle did not work. These are a great value and so comfy. The bottom is just right - not too wide, and the waistband is also a good and comfy fit."
5.0,"Soft, stretchy, fit right. I love these. I had laparoscopic surgery last week and completely forgot to plan for what I would wear during healing. I wore PJ's to and from the hospital but once I had to start venturing into the real world again I wanted something a little ""nicer"".These are the perfect fit and so comfortable. And they aren't high waters like some open leg sweatpants. They're soft and stretchy and the colors I got don't look dingy like some. Love em!"
5.0,Perfect for me! I neglected to think about the length! They fit just fine in the waist and hips = glad I didn't order the size smaller as suggested.
5.0,Love the fit I love wearing these pants. The fit is perfect and so very comfortable. I ordered a medium.Highly recommend and would order again.
5.0,"Super comfy I am in love with these sweat pants. I bought them when they went in sale and they have become my favorite pair by far. I like my sweats to be a little loose so I bought a large and they fit great. I wear a 10/12 in jeans. They are pretty long though. I could roll the bottoms up 2 inches or so if I wanted them to not drag, but I wear them to lounge around the house. I'm 5'5"
5.0,"fit previous reviews stated that these ran large and to go a size smaller.  So that's what I did.  They were very long and a little loose around the waist.  However, after being washed/dried the first time the length was almost just right."
5.0,"Just what I wanted! Like the color, length and fit. Wish they had pockets but otherwise meets my needs. I ordered extra large as these types of pants are too short for me. Length is perfect but the waist is a bit loose due to larger size."
5.0,Perfect ‚Äúouter layer‚Äù I had a problem. My apt complex has a gym but it‚Äôs 2 buildings away. I wanted to put my workout clothes on at home and walk over to the gym. No problem in the warm months but now it‚Äôs December in Chicago and leggings just don‚Äôt cut it outside. Enter these guys. They‚Äôre thick enough to make my legs no longer turn into popsicles and loose enough to not look all bunched up and weird on top of my workout pants. Win win. Oh and they‚Äôre cheap. Hooray!
5.0,"What a bargain! I didn't know what to expect.  I've never bought sweat pants online.  To my surprise they were a perfect fit.  I ordered a different color, that one was too large and too long.  I will definitely take a chance on a bargain like this again."
5.0,"Loose and comfortable I bought these for my mother. She‚Äôs 93 and broke her leg. She has a cat from mid thigh to the base of her toes. I bought these because they have wide legs. They are too long for her (5‚Äô5‚Äù), but slide right over that cast. They are mid weight and she is very comfortable it them. Look fine, too."
5.0,"Love them, wish they had pockets!! Love them, wish they had pockets!"
5.0,"order petite if you are not very tall I ordered these sweats in both XL regular and petite.  Im 5'5.5 190lbs. The regular were too long, petite was the perfect length. Am returning them and reordering in size L because they were FAR too loose in the waist. Was good quality and look forward to getting the size L petite.Edit: I recieved the size L petite and they were the perfect size/length."
5.0,Perfect for me! Perfect. I wanted a cheap pair of warm fuzzy and loose pants to wear when I'm home alone.I bought the small. They are loose but perfect for my needs. I wanted them loose. They don't fall down or anything.I am 5'9 129 pounds. I wear a 2-4 depending on the brand.But I'm prolly more like a 4 usually.Soft... Not creepy weird material.
5.0,"great fit, great price! Very soft, nice color and are very comfortable and warm!"
5.0,"nice sweat pants. -no pockets I missed in the product description that these sweat pants have no pockets. So I will not purchase again. Otherwise nicely sewn, I like the wide stretchy waist. I am 5'4"" and got size large and they are about 2 inches too long. I just fold up the bottom of the pants. Otherwise very comfortable."
5.0,"Pretty and soft Not quite as warm as expected but very comfortable, they are really nice to wear to my short walk and mild exercise followed by hours of sitting."
5.0,Love these These were inexpensive and just what I needed for bumming  around the house. The only only thing that would improve them is pockets!
5.0,Grey Sweatpant I got these sweatpants & I just LOVE them !!!  Perfect fit from waist to toes.  I bought these originally @ Walmart but the quality changed so I did not buy again until I saw these & I bought a pair -- enjoyed wearing them -- am buying a couple more pairs.
5.0,It doesn't have pockets These are lightly fleeced pants in small that fit well.I wished I'd noticed no pocketsOtherwise I like them.
5.0,Extremely soft and comfy. Just order a smaller size than normal I am normally a size medium. I had to exchange the original pair for a size small as they were way too loose. Small fits perfectly. I'm short and these pants are not too long so they may not fit someone tall but are fine for me
5.0,"Order a size down! But love ‚ô° These are super soft. But LONG and big. They run large, so order a size down. I typically wear medium. (5'6"") super long. But I can't complain much... for the price.... I shouldn't be allowed to complain! I will order again but in a small. Dont let this deter you. Love these... just need the right size :)"
5.0,Comfy sweat pants I got the sweats because I wanted something that I could wear around the house. Also I have a problem getting them long enough since I am 5 foot 7 1/2 and need a 32 inch inseam. They were perfect and very comfortable.
5.0,"Not cute but v comfy You definitely won't get anyone's attention in these pants, but omg are they comfy. They do run a bit big. I'm 5'8, 125 lbs. I ordered the small and they're definitely baggy and loose around the waist, but I'm just wearing them for walking the dog/working at home, so it works."
5.0,"Very soft and comfortable. Sizes run big. 160 lbs, 5'3"". Large is too big. Very comfortable. Should have ordered a size smaller. Happy with the purchase."
5.0,Tese are nice sweat pants . I wish I had not read reviews (several) that said they run large and to order the next size down . They run a tad large but not a size larger . My daughter was happy because she got the pants and I reordered .These look and feel so nice .
5.0,Great quality but way too big for me...how do I return them? Well I love them but they are too large. How do I return them? If I didn't know better I'd think that I lost weight.
5.0,"Fit good but alil long Fit great on my wife she's 130 an 5,6..but alil long in legs"
5.0,Comfy for my mom during colder months. Not bad for colder days for my mom. Fit was a bit snug but over all a good buy.
5.0,"Runs long It's supposed to be a petite, which means I shouldn't have to hem/shorten the legs' length; however, it does indicate in the reviews that the slacks run big/long.  I wasn't surprised about the need to alter the leg length.  The slacks are very comfortable---I've just ordered more."
5.0,Wish they had pockets Very comfortable. Got a bit knobby.
5.0,"It fits perfectly I'm 5'6"", 159lb, size M fits perfectly. It's warm, good for winter and looks very good. Good price, super fast drlivery"
5.0,"Love them! I love these sweatpants! Super soft, and for me, the perfect fit. I bought some (same brand) at Walmart, and they were smaller than these, so they might be a little bigger than some people are expecting, but I love everything about them. I've been buying g them for years!"
5.0,"Great pants, but darker than expected. I ordered the light grey. Color was a bit darker than expected (the image makes it look closer to white, but it's really just standard light grey), but the pants are super comfortable. They do run a bit large, although i expected that since i read the previous reviews. Definitely great considering the cost."
5.0,"great product as usual Needed pink sweats to go with a pink tie dye sweatshirt. These look and fit great. I usually wear between S and M but after reading other reviews I ordered small. Glad I did because these are slightly big at waist. I am 5'7"" 125 lbs...length was fine. Would buy again"
5.0,"Bought these for gifts... My sister just LOVED these... she's a little bigger in the ""bottom""... so I was hoping these would fit, and they did!  Whew, I was afraid we might need to return them... they're a size larger than her ""normal"" size... but they fit her just fine."
5.0,Very true to size I usually wear a 2X in any pants but the XL is a little oversized for me. Extremely comfortable and soft. I will be ordering more but just the large I think will do. I am 5'6 195lbsj
5.0,"They need pockets Very comfortable, easy to get on and off. Wish they had pockets."
5.0,Great basic sweat pant This is a basic fleece sweat pant without pockets or drawstring waist. A size small fits a 5‚Äô4‚Äù woman who weighs 132 pounds with 36‚Äù  slim hips perfectly. The length is perfect with flats or athletic shoes without dragging on the floor.
5.0,Very Comfortable These are WAY more comfortable than I thought they would be. I really like them and wear them around the house and sometimes to sleep in. they come up to my belly button but sometimes slide down to my hips so I have to pull them back up when that happens but it's not often enough to really be annoying.
5.0,"BUY THESE ! These are $11!!! Wicked comfortable, super cheap. Bigger than expected. I just ordered another pair in a size smaller. I just can‚Äôt believe how great these are."
5.0,Soft warm and comfy Great sweats to put on after work to relax in or the wear after a work out to cool down.
5.0,Perfect but had to size down 1 size I read all the reviews and expected the pants to be short because my legs are long but I have to say they are long if anything and do run large but they are perfect lounge pants. Exactly what I wanted!
5.0,"Good product I ordered these in four different colors. I find them very comfortable and I likethe fact that they do not have pockets which make them very smooth and flatteringat the hip. I would recommend them to anyone who wants comfortable, flatteringsweatpants. I wear a 8 -10 regular and they fit perfectly."
5.0,"Comfortable for the cooler weather These actually fit very well, good around the hips and in the legs, length is good, the waist is a little loose but I would prefer this over having a pant fit too tight around the hips and thighs, so all is all its comfortable and a great price, I would buy again in the different color."
5.0,"Soft, comfy, and warm--what else could you want in purple sweat pants in winter during a pandemic? As a Raven's Fan from Baltimore, I like purple.  Also, I can wear them as comfy pajamas.  They do well in the wash, too.  I'm not a careful laundry doer.  Sometimes I just throw it all in together-all colors and weights-everything comes out fine."
5.0,"Great comfort and affordable! These pants are super soft and super comfortable yet sturdy and hold up well during laundering. They run very large, I originally ordered size large and exchanged for size medium which are perfect. Nicely priced too, I plan to order more of these, they're my new work from home winter wardrobe üòä"
5.0,Perfect fit‚Ä¶a little loose Fits as expected and a bit loose. Bought a size large for a size 14
5.0,"Great for laying around I'm 5""2 and 245 the 2x fit waist like I need. The length is alittle long but I'm also super short. So thats usually the case for me anyways. They are super soft. There also stood comfy. These are my new favorite lounge pants"
5.0,Great if you know how to size them These are exactly what I need for working overnights. Only wish they had pockets but for the price they are great. Listen to the others and size down. I am apple shaped so I only went down one size however if you run small waist compared to your hips go down two sizes.
5.0,"Very comfy pants. I am 5ft 6in (120 lbs) and ordered Small.  The pants fit perfectly, they are not tight at the waist.  They are not adjusted but rather loose.  They are very comfy and soft fabric (casual).  I like to wear them around the house and outside."
5.0,Great fit.  Super comfy. Love these pants.  They do run big.  I usually order large pants but another person posted to get smaller and I did and they fit perfectly.  Instead of large ordered medium and they were perfect.So very comfortable.  Ordering two more in different colors.
5.0,Hanes has made a winner for these sweatpants! I love these sweatpants from Hanes. I ordered size small. I'm 5'3 weigh 117 pds. The pants fit as expected. I normally wear blue jeans when I go out in the public but with the slim fit without pockets these are my go to pants now. I have washed them in cold water and there isn't any shrinkage.  I just ordered 3 more pairs for this winter with Hanes sweatshirts to match. I've never been disappoint when it comes buying warm clothes from Hanes.
5.0,"All Set for Winter Got me some sweats to exercise and just hang out in.  I am 5'4"" 120 lbs, bought Medium and they are perfect, especially since they are not pricey.  I think next time I will get the ones with elastic at the ankles, but these are fine, I'm happy to have them."
5.0,"Just what I was hoping for! I wanted a pair of comfy warm pants to lounge in. These are perfect for that. They fit as expected and don‚Äôt rise up like a thinner band does. The quality is great- they have a sweat pant type of material. Overall, very happy for the price!"
5.0,Soft and comfortable I ordered a size too large. Very comfortable and gave them to a friend who they will fit better. Like the way They look while wearing them and the fabric is very soft
5.0,"So soft!! These pants are wonderful. Soft and comfy, warm without being too hot. They fit comfortably around the waist and are just long enough. I will go back and buy the rest of the colors. Perfect for lounging around the house.The only thing better would be pockets."
5.0,"Sturdy, warm, and cozy! A great price for a super comfy pair of sweats. These are suitable for wearing around the house or running out to the mailbox, but I wouldn‚Äôt wear them in public. I bought 5 As the price is amazing and so I can have soft warm pj pants all fall, winter, and spring."
5.0,My 85 yr old mother absolutely loves these as much as I do! Purchased for my mother who struggles to walk and is always cold.  She loves them and the stretch and softness they have.  She is 85 and this is probably her first pair of pants like this.
5.0,"great value comfortable, a little long, wash up very well"
5.0,short in the stride but they work The rise is very low compared to other sweat pants I have purchased.
5.0,Comfortable hang around pants! I bought these pants to hang around the house - - very comfortable!
5.0,"Pant Length These pants fit me exactly how I wanted them to. I'm 5'4"" and have trouble finding sweatshirt that got past my ankle. These ones go to the floor, but with shoes on, they are the perfect length to not drag on the ground and still cover my legs."
5.0,Comfy Comfy and warm.  Good sweat pants reasonably priced.Happy with purchase.
5.0,Good fit and quality. Very good quality for the price.  I wear these to PT for my knee.  Loose enough on leg opening that I can pull up over my knee. Warm.  Comfy for lounging but thick enough to wear out of the house.
5.0,Comfort! They are just what I was hoping for!  After washing and drying they were perfect fit...and so comfortable!  I have three pair now and will probably order another color soon!  Thanks Annie
5.0,"Very satisfied They are very practical pants and are comfy, soft and at a great price! The do run big though I'd suggest getting a size down. I am usually a L but got a M this time and is perfect! I am 4""11 weighing about 160"
5.0,Listen to previous reviews that say product runs large I did and am glad I did. Read previous reviews and many mentioned they run large so I ordered a large instead of xlarge and they fit perfectly. The length is too long for my 5‚Äô4‚Äù but I expected that since they don‚Äôt come in a short length - I‚Äôll deal with that. Price is wonderful - I‚Äôm ordering more.
5.0,Very comfy -will buy again Bought these for my daughter to wear during the winter for PE. She immediately put them on and I had to buy multiples. It keeps her warm with out keeping her hot. They made it through a sanitary wash without shrinking or issues with the fabric. Will buy again. I would normally buy a large for length but ordered a Medium becuase of the pervious comments. The lenght is perfect
5.0,Good deal. Love these pants. They do run a little short. I had some from last year and they are really long.
5.0,"Can‚Äôt beat the price Material is thick, which is niceLegs are wider than I would have likedBut great for the price"
5.0,"Fabulous and 'Green' Too! These are basic/plain black sweatpants. There is a wide, comfortable waistband. No pockets. Soft material (could sleep in them). Perfect for lounging during 'work from home.' I'm 5'6"" and they are just a little long without shoes. I like that they are made out of recycled plastic. I'm a basic size 18-20 or XXL - these fit around my tummy area and aren't too tight."
5.0,"Why can‚Äôt these come in petite x-small ?? Love these, but very tue to size. Make sure you order based on waist not by size pants you normally buy. Mine are too large, but still gave a 5 star bc they are so comfortable!  Guess they are pj bottoms now"
5.0,Great comfort... Love the product...runs large so I bought medium...fit well.
5.0,"Snug as a big in a rug! These pants are soo comfy.  Yes, they are a little big but being 50% cotton you could make them smaller in the dryer.  I‚Äôd much rather have them a tad larger than a tad smaller.  They are warm but thin enough for Fl all year round wear."
5.0,"Fit just right, comfy I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äù, wear size 12 jeans.  The large in black fit perfect. Not too short, not too long. Waist band wasn‚Äôt too tight and not too loose.Good lounger sweats. Would be better with pockets. Good for the price"
5.0,"Runs big I am size 6 in pants, I ordered a medium and had to send it back and get a small, which fit just right"
5.0,Comfortable!!!!!!!!! I love the warmth and feel of them. I wear Xlarge and ordered large but they were still too big in the waist and hips. I‚Äôm ok with them cause I just wear them in the house. Next time I will order medium though.
5.0,"Inconsistent in Sizing I'm a little disappointed. I've order these pants twice now, the first time I ordered a few colors and they ran a little loose. The second time I ordered only black and they fit just fine, however they were more money"
5.0,"Love it! and fits me perfectly I lost some weight, ao I am ordering two more in a smaller size.Really comfortable and looks good"
5.0,"Great pants for price Pants are very soft & comfortable! They were just a little bit bigger than I expected, but not to the point of falling off or enough to go down a size. The color was accurate. I would gladly order another pair!"
5.0,"Great fit and great price I recently had abdominal surgery and it will be a while before I can wear my jeans, these pants were perfect to wear when going out, don't look like typical sweat pants and I can feel a bit dressed up."
5.0,SO COMFY! Comfortable fit -- the inside is incredibly soft! My new favorite sweatpants. The only downside is no pockets.
5.0,"Your average sweatpants I got these during a sale. I probably wouldn't pay full price for them, but for what I paid they're worth it. Very comfortable and fit like average sweatpants would. I just wish they had pockets."
5.0,"Comfortable sweats I work from home so I live in sweats. These are super comfy to lounge around the house in, plus I can run to the store in them. They are a little long as I am 5‚Äô5, the heel touches the floor. But again I don‚Äôt mind since I wear them around the house.  I bought two pairs, Will go back and buy a few more. Great price!"
5.0,"Soooooooooo comfy! I'm going to buy at least three more.  These are so soft and fit so well, even loose. I'm usually a 12, so I ordered a large.  I could've easily ordered a medium.  If you're between sizes or unsure,  size down."
5.0,"My waist 29-30 inches, size medium waistband was a bit bigger I ordered a medium. My waist is 29-30inches and the waistband was definitely a bit bigger than a usual medium. The pants are comfy though, so the waist can easily be sewn down to the right fit, or can be worn on the hips. I haven‚Äôt washed them yet, so will wait to see if the waist fits after a few washes."
5.0,"Fit great and are comfortable. I got 2 pairs for a resident at a nursing home I work at. She says they fit perfectly and are very comfortable, she always wears them and always tells me she‚Äôs going to give me money for more of them."
5.0,"Good value. Order next size down from your usual. I ordered this in XL first. Too big. So I ordered again, this time Large. Perfect fit. Very happy with this, perfect, very good value at the price I got. So I ordered another pair in Large. I am 5'9"", usually wear XL."
5.0,"Liked them so much, bought a second pair I wear these for daily use, love the soft inner terry fabric.  I've found it's best to wash inside out before wearing so as to avoid lint sticking to my stockings.  Overall, love the value and price of these pants"
5.0,"Love these The first pair I ordered was too large, so I ordered a size down on the next two pairs. These pants are very cozy. Great for around the house, and warm!  Again, they do run large on the sizes."
5.0,Good. Order a size down. Runs large I read the reviews and ordered a size smaller. This was a good idea as it fits and is not tight. Don‚Äôt want tight sweatpants. These are warm but long in the legs. I cut mine off so they would fit more like pants and I didn‚Äôt have to cuff them twice over. This is likely me at 5‚Äô2‚Äù but the legs did ae quite long. Otherwise they are nice and you can‚Äôt beat the price for them.
5.0,Love these! I am 5‚Äô10‚Äù and these pants fit perfect.  I have several pair and I love these.  Comfortable enough to lounge in yet I could easily wear out to the store for errands.  Well made and warm.  Love these pants.  Good price too!
5.0,"Soft and warm, no pockets. So soft inside! Love the fabric. Nicely sewn, great quality for the price. The waistband is wide, which is great. It‚Äôs slightly looser than expected at the waist, and I wish there was a drawstring. Also wish there were pockets, but life isn‚Äôt perfect."
5.0,"Love them, but yes, they are HUGE! I didn't heed the warnings about these being too large, so I ordered a medium.  Holy moley!  They were huge!  Here is my size...I am 5'7 and 135 lbs.  I wear a 6 or 8 these days and figured a medium would be perfect.  OMG they felt so good but I wouldn't even want to answer the door in the too large size, so I returned for a small, and they are perfect.  Super soft, super warm...I love them!  For the price?  I am getting more!!!"
5.0,"Comprar√© m√°s Le√≠ las rese√±as y lo compre M por que bienen en tallas mas grandes, si eres L o XL el M queda perfecto, son calientitos, no me puedo quejar eel material pues por el precio cre√≥ que son demasiado buenos y son de uso diarios, recomendado"
5.0,Good fit but long I got medium feeling hopeful but the legs had to be rolled a little but it was nice around waist!
5.0,Easy on ! Bought these for my 80 year old mom - easy to change into and comfy fit !
5.0,Perfect fit and warm for the winter months Like the product.  Good quality and product for the price.  Great deal
5.0,"My new favorite pants Putting these sweatpants on bring me so much joy. They are soooo comfy. Perfect when you just don‚Äôt want something tight or clingy. I‚Äôm curvy, short, and of average weight for my height and these fit me great."
5.0,Love that they match the top I also bought They fit perfectly and match the top I bought. Sweats are great for at home stuff and we are mostly at home these days.  The price is very reasonable as well. A very good deal.
5.0,Great pajama pants Very soft inside. Run big. Wish there was a draw string or better elastic at the waist. But great deal!
5.0,"Comfy, run large, wide legs As previous reviewers mention, these sweatpants run large. I got a large and an x-large and the x-large are almost too big. They are both very comfy lounge wear type sweats. The legs are very wide at the bottom, something I wasn‚Äôt expecting. They are kind of like bell bottoms."
5.0,"this item keeps you warm fits nice, legs do not ride up and they wash nice"
5.0,Worth your money I am very happy with the product. Good quality. Better than I expected.
5.0,"Perfect sweatpants! Bought a size down after reading reviews and glad I did. They fit perfect. I have another style of Hanes womens sweats that are medium and are definitely tighter than this medium so reviewers are right that they are sized bigger. These are thick sweatpants material and are very comfy! Length was perfect. I am 5'6"", currently 37 weeks pregnant and 180 lbs."
5.0,Comfortable and warm. These pants are for my mother is who is 78 years old.  Needed something that was warm and easy for her to pull on and off.  She likes the softness of the fabric and says they are very comfortable and warm.
5.0,Awesome! Comfortable! Will pull at the thighs but that is easy enough to fix. Not super stylish but a solid pair of sweatpants! These do run big- order at least 1 size down.
5.0,Love these but run really large in waist I ordered by the size chart and they still ran big. Really comfortable.
5.0,"Very comfortable These sweatpants are so comfortable, fit beautifully, and are nice enough to wear casually.  I just ordered two more pairs in different colors I like them so much.  They are a little long on me, but I probably should have bought the petite size."
5.0,"Excellent fit Item arrived promptly.  Fabric is good quality thickness, and very soft. The sweatpants are very comfortable. They would be excellent choice for someone that had recent surgery and cannot have anything tight on their abdomen."
5.0,"Great Inexpensive Pants! These inexpensive pants are great for winter lounging!  They are thick and comfortable.  My only complaint is that they are a little too long (just barely), but the up side is that my ankles stay warm!"
5.0,Update This is an update. WASH THIS ALONE!! I read the previous reviews about the lint and they were spot on. I washed this with a bath mat that also sheds. These pants were worse.
5.0,"So comfy Just what I hoped for. Long enough, soft and roomy. They do run big. I usually wear a medium but ordered small after reading reviews, and there is plenty of room. For the price...perfect. I‚Äôll be ordering another pair."
5.0,"The ideal winter lounge pant Some of my favorite features:No seams on outside legsOpen legs at the bottomNo waist tieWide and comfortable ribbed waistbandVery softLasts through tons of washing (had my first pair for years, still look/feel great)"
5.0,"Good quality I've just spent less on these that I'd spend buying a drink and sandwich.  Totally impressed by the quality. They're long enough for my 5'7"" height.  Though think about buying a size smaller than you usually get, as these are generously sized."
5.0,"Perfect fit, love the open leg, wish they had pockets. Perfect pants especially for the price. These fit very well. I do wish they had pockets but I still love them. Also I have noticed with frequent wear the insides of the thighs are rubbing into little fabric balls. I‚Äôd still buy them again though!"
5.0,Best Deal Ever I got these a size down since everyone said they run big and they fit perfect.  I loved them so much I bought a few more.  I live in these as soon as I get home every day.  And for $7.50 each - it‚Äôs the best deal ever!
5.0,"Just What I Needed In Comfortable Pants These pants were just what I was looking for to wear post-kidney removal surgery. The soft flat waistband that sits higher than mid-belly is perfect. The pants are soft and comfortable, and I'm glad I ordered four pairs!"
5.0,Better fit Fits well  waist fits comfortably length is good
5.0,"A little big I wear a small to medium size pants, usually.  I bought the medium, but they're pretty baggy.  I still wear them, though, and they're comfy.  Also, I have short legs, and had to hem these."
5.0,"Comfy! In the description I was warned that these run large, so I ordered a size smaller than my normal size. They fit perfectly. I love the color, the fit, the fabric. These are too long for me, but I am quite short and accustomed to shortening all my pants. I'm sure they would fit average to tallish women without seeming skimpy. The hem could be let down, but it is only about 3/4 inch with serging at the bottom. These wash and dry well without shrinkage."
5.0,Comfortable house pants no pockets These are great for lounging and convalescence. Very cozy. I wish they had pockets. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2 and they are slightly too long.
5.0,Nice sweats with wide legs Fit is loose and the pant leg is wide.  This is a good thing but I would but 1 size down next time. I wear a 16 jean and ordered a large.  Will buy these again!
5.0,"Order 1 Size Down After reading reviews to order a size down, I did. I‚Äôm a size 18-20 plus size 1x and ordered an XL which are slightly big in the waist which doesn‚Äôt deter. They are comfy and roomy and the price was great!"
5.0,"Love these pant These pants have been great loungewear. I love so much that I purchased 3 more pair for myself...then ordered some for my mom and sister. They are great pants, and true to size. I recommend."
5.0,"Good So sad :(Bought these as a gift for my mama,... they were huge on her, good thing they fit me tho :)Good quality.. bought another pair for her this time xl... recomend they do run a little baggy in the legs tho"
5.0,Comfortable I like the material and I like the way they fit.  My only problem is they were definitely too long but I did shorten them myself and now they are comfortable. I just ordered two more pair.
5.0,"Super comfy, fits well These pants are super comfy! I'm short (5'2"")  so they are long on me like everything is, but I like my sweatpants long to keep my feet warm. They do pill in the inner thighs right away, but I'm hoping that improves after a wash or two."
5.0,"Great sweatpants I loved everything about the product, but haven‚Äôt seen other posts, I ordered a size below. When I got my large sweatpants they were way too big and I need to order them as a small size"
5.0,Satisfied! I am about 130 lbs an I got a medium..this is my second pair of sweats by them and I love it!  Very warm!  Love wearing them to work and the material is great! Highly recommend.
5.0,"Just what I wanted! Great value! These sweatpants were just what I wanted. I wear them to bed but they are also fine for jogging or running errands. They fit me the same as any hanes brand typically does. I am 5'6"" and about 150lbs and I got a medium and it fits great. Not too snug but also not too baggy. I will be purchasing more at this price!"
5.0,Very happy Ordered one pair on clearance and was happy with quality and fit.  Was surprised the pants were still on clearance and they still had my size.  So purchased 2 more pairs.  I got a bargain.
5.0,"Nice I ordered 3 more pair in different colors. The first pair I bought was a little big so h next pair I did just by the large and it fits perfectly. The only thing that could make them better, pockets."
5.0,Perfect pants I LOVE these pants. I usually wear a 18 so ordered the xxl. They were way big. Ordered an xl. Perfect. They do run big. But they are nice and long and fabric soft. I want a pair in every color!
5.0,Good value sweatpants Good price for diesel sweatpants. I wish they would‚Äôve had pockets.
5.0,"So comfortable These pants are a bit long, I am 5'6, but I don't mind. I love them! They are so soft, so comfortable and a great fit around the waist. They are baggy, but I ordered an XL because I wanted a relaxed fit."
5.0,"Warm & cozy, but run Large Order a size smaller. These run big & long. They drag on me & I'm 5'3. 140lbs. I bought a medium,  they fit me big. Even after wash & dry they did not shrink.  Warm & cozy, but run large."
5.0,"Definitely recommend So comfortable and so soft. Would definitely recommend. I read the reviews and decided to order a size smaller, like recommended, then I usually would. They do run big so I would definitely order a size smaller. I'll definitely order another pair."
5.0,"Soft and comfortable Love these pants, very soft and comfortable with just enough stretch to move with you. The length is good I would definitely buy these again I just wish they had more colors available."
5.0,"Both comfy and styliah I really like how they hug my legs and flare at the bottom.  This is my second time ordering, they are my go to sweats and also feel comfortable wearing them when I'm running errands."
5.0,"Just what I was looking for These pants are so comfortable and warm! I needed some sweats to throw on when I walk my dogs during the winter. These are loose enough I can wear some leggings underneath but not so big they‚Äôre hanging off. I‚Äôd say they are a mid weight. I can wear them alone in 20-30 weather and still feel comfortable. And they are the perfect length (I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4). I now have 3 pair, can‚Äôt beat the price!"
5.0,Comfy cozy pants Comfy house pants.  Fit as expected. Normally wear a size 6
5.0,"Hanes Softness Never fails I like my sweatpants large, I ordered them that way on purpose. They are literally to veg out in. I exercise in spandex..  Love the warm cozy softness Hanes provides!"
5.0,Order a size smaller I like the fit of these sweat pants and am glad I read the reviews before purchase.  I wear a medium but ordered a small and they fit perfectly.  This is a light weight sweat pant and perfect for walking.
5.0,Great sweats! Love these sweats!  The only thing that could make them better would be if there was a pocket.The Amazon suggestion that these run large is correct.  Make sure you order a size down.
5.0,"The legs are way too long. Nice winter comfort pants, but I need to be more careful shopping amazon.I pay for prime, but it will cost more to return, as it seems thesedo not qualify. I will give them to the homeless and we can all feel good."

5.0,so comfortable Love these sweatpants.  The fabric is soft and the pants did not shrink in the dryer.  The fit and length are  perfect.
5.0,"Fits well - even the length I like the look of these on. I went with a size medium (I‚Äôm a 10-12). They‚Äôre a tad snug when I put them on, but then they‚Äôre just right. The length is good too. I like the smooth lines without pockets so they fit nicely under shirts without looking too much like sweats. I may order another pair. I‚Äôm waiting to see how they last, but so far they‚Äôre washing well too."
5.0,"Great maternity pants These were just what I needed for maternity pants. They do run large, but the waist band is not a tight elastic which feels very nice in your first trimester. Just what I was needing for a sensitive feeling tummy during this time and a great price...but as far as your regular sizing goes, I would recommend sizing down unless you want super baggy comfies. Nothing like a new soft pair of sweats."
5.0,"Ecosmart pants It was advised on the site that the pants ran large. I bought 1 size down for an awesome fit. I needed pants that could be put on with 1 hand. I  was very happy with my initial purchase, so I bought more."

5.0,"Order one size smaller than your normal size Order one size smaller than your normal size. May feel tight at first because it‚Äôs a yoga pant tighter fit, not a baggy jogging pants fit. But they get more comfy as you wear them. They look like they could be work pants. I wear them to work at my rather casual business casual workplace."
5.0,st nice and comfy
5.0,Traditional sweat pant Perfect covid pants during winter. Although I don‚Äôt think I should get used to them. Yikes! They run big the minute they feel tight I‚Äôm back in jeans!

5.0,"Comfortable Someone mentioned that these pants ran big so instead of a ex- large I ordered a large, they are still a little too big. But very comfortable."
5.0,"I bought three pair and I really like them! I would love them more if they ... I read the reviews before buying these pants- I wanted them to be a little big as I will need them for when I am recuperating from shoulder surgery. They are soft and cozy but large enough for me to be able  to get them on and off with one hand. I bought three pair and I really like them! I would love them more if they had pockets, but they are a great buy for the price!"
5.0,"Very nice for the price! WarmComfortableFleecy insideSoft materialWaist band is soft, flexible, stretchyI bought a MEDIUM and it feels like a LARGE. But it stays up just fine, isn't falling down because of the stretchy waist band.Great for in house lounging, exercise, or running errandsThey do run long (for a 5'4"" frame, the bottoms had to be hemmed an inch or two)They're boxy, not giving you a flattering look, but who cares? For $8 they are comfortable and warm for winter days."

5.0,Love these pants. This is my 4th pair. I will definitely order more. I like these for the fit and comfort.
5.0,"Perfect for My Needs These are a little large on me, but it's OK because I wanted them a little large.  I'm 5' 8""/130 lbs. and purchased them as pre-marathon sweats (just to keep warm until the start of the race) that would fit easily over what I plan to wear for the race and will come off easily just before the race begins. The price is right, plus someone will receive a new pair of sweatpants since the discarded clothing is picked up and donated."
5.0,Soft Soft  comfy  perfect lounge pant
5.0,"Very comfortable They are very comfortable! They sit just below my waist. They are not tight at all, nor loose that you'd loose them walking.  Grear price too!"
5.0,Confortable These pants are so comfortable. I was looking for an alternative to scrubs due to pregnancy and these are very comfortable. I ordered an x-large so they fit loose but that's what I wanted
5.0,comfort waistband and overall The comfort waistband makes this great.  Looks presentably neat and feels very comfortable.  Purchased size 2X and often with larger sizes you end up with the waistband riding up to your rib cage but that is not the case with these:  lower rise so band sits at waist.  50% cotton/50% poly blend.
5.0,It runs big! I am glad I read the other comments and purchased a small size. I am usually a medium but purchased a small regular size. Fits well! I just wish there were a little longer (my height is 5‚Äô 6‚Äù). Very comfortable! I am planning to buy more.

5.0,Soft but not actual size I like the style and they are soft but too big. I always order XL for comfy bottoms and these are more like a 2x. I was disappointed in that regard.

5.0,Fits perfect It is so hard for me to find pants that fit my ridiculously long legs. These fit amazing and they're so comfortable. I ordered 2 more pairs after trying the first pair.
5.0,Runs full in size I love the quality - well made- runs very full- maybe best to downsize

5.0,It‚Äôs a nice pant I like to wear them a lot
5.0,"Comfy These sweats are great at they are long enough and I'm 5'9 In. tall.  They get a bit baggy after a few hours so I just wash them when needed and let them air dry.  Then, I throw them in the dryer for just a few minutes to shrink them back enough."

5.0,"Nice pants Great pants, soft and warm. They do run large, usually I‚Äôm XL, after reading reviews ordered L . Got a good fit. Will order more in the future"
5.0,Perfectly comfy lounge pants! I found the Hanes Women's Middle Rise Sweat pants to be perfect for lounge and pajama pants. They were on the large size so if I wanted to wear them for the gym I'd go down a size. But for my needs at the time they are perfect and they wash and dry without any shrinking problems. They material is very soft and comfy. I was extremely happy with my purchase and will probably buy more!
