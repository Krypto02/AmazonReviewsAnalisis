1.0,"Odd fit, not people with long legs The material was a medium weight, quality made. Product was as described and true to color. The material was soft to the touch.Unfortunately the pants did not fit well for me. The waist was too loose, the legs a bit tight in the thighs. I was disappointed that the wait had NO elastic just a draw string (I hoped for at least a partial elastic waist band) that one is my mistake.Over all it was an odd fit long in the rise and short in the inseam. A total no go for me. It was like putting on my grandma's pants where the waist sits at your bra and the pant leg is way above your ankle....great visual, right! Ugh! I returned them.."
1.0,"Pull-0n Pants with a Polyester Feel and look I don't like the look or feel of these pants.  Some polyester looks more like cotton.  These pants look very much like polyester, which is not as appealing to me.  The medium size is large and the length of the inseam measures 30 1/2 inches, which should be good for me, buck end up being about two inches too long.  Can't explain it.  They are not flattering and do not have enough fabric in the back - it feels short and the waist in the back is lower than in the front. I feel overall that they look cheap and are poorly made.  I love other Hanes things, like boxy sweatshirts, but these don't have the same quality to me."
1.0,"Disappointed I'm so disappointed with this purchase I thought when other purchasers were complaining about the sizing of these comfy sweatpants I honestly thought they were exaggerating, but then when I received mine and opened I came to realize weren't joking about how huge it ran, I wear a size small this size waist looks like a large. I was speechless and so disappointed that I regrated wasting my money on this trash honestly, I mainly got this to wear to work at night since the job I do is very physically active so I wanted a comfy yoga-type pant to be able to move around easily so when I saw it I decided to give it try not knowing it was a total waste of money and trash. The color I got was pretty but other than that it's a waste of money and the sizes are very unrealistic. So I most definitely wouldn't recommend this product to anyone."
1.0,"Strange fit.. I don't know what's wrong but on all of the pants of this brand that I purchased I ended up sending back. Those that I missed the return date on I donated to charity, hoping someone will like the fit. The length is fine. the waistband is ok in the front but the back feels very strange and doesn't come all the way up to the waist. I don't have much of a b--t so I think the crotch seems is messed up....on all 6 pairs of pants I got.They may be a comfortable fit for others but I cannot recommend them."
1.0,Fit is off A few years ago I purchased Hanes sweatpants at Walmart which were great - very inexpensive and the fit was excellent. These go by the same description but they are in no way the same. I’m 120 - 123 lbs. and the size small was perfect in the older version. These smalls are very different - tight in the seat but the waistband is too big. Live and learn….wish the old sizes would come back.
1.0,"Don't recommend these sweatpants I used to buy these sweatpants at Walmart, but they don't carry them anymore, so I ordered a pair online.  I have hardly worn them & only washed them once or twice, and already they look & feel awful because they have ugly ""pills"" all over the fabric (see the photo) My older Hanes sweatpants didn't do like that.  Don't waste your money on these.  Hanes - you can do better - you have before."
1.0,"Is not accurate to size guide I ordered a size small, my hips are 25in around these pants are not small at all, I could legitimately fit 2 more of my legs into the pants. I was super bummed because they are cute but dear god are they huge  do not by if you are a actual size small"
1.0,"Poorly made I never write reviews. But these sweats are not quality sweats. Poor fit at the waist. Very little elasticity. Long in the crotch , legs too wide. I will wear them around the house. But, I wouldn’t wear them out in public."
1.0,"Hanes Eco-smart sweatpants Read the reviews, the fit on these pants are horrible. Length is too long, abdomen/crotch area is puffy while back of pants are very scant. No pockets or drawstring waist."
1.0,REJECTS - FIT WEIRD AND GET REALLY LOOSE AS THE DAY GOES ON TOTAL dissapointment - fit funny in the backside - they shrunk after one washing and fall down as the day goes on.  I have a good figure so not sure why this happens.  they should just give me my money back!!
1.0,"What happened to Hanes? Ordered 3 pairs of these with the sweatshirts. Even the small is too large and I received one pair that fit like a 3X. Labeled incorrectly. Material is very thin and overall, fits poorly; waist is too big, butt is too ample and way too long. Used to wear these all the time. Fit better and thicker material. What happened to Hanes?"
1.0,"Comfortable but…. The pants felt good on but after one day of wearing them, they had all kinds of little knots on the pants from piling. Not what I expected for one wear! I would love to give these pants a better review but quality needs some work"
1.0,Run Very Large! Purchased 3 pair of these a year ago (Medium) and loved them for casual around-the-house slacks.  I normally wear a size 8-10 and those purchased last year fit perfectly.  This order was for 3 more pair again in size Medium.  The slacks I received in this order are HUGE and very long.  Such a disappointment--had to return.  Will look for these locally so I can try them on.
1.0,No shape These might be a man's cut.  They are definitely not a woman's shape.  There was no waist line.  Maybe I just ordered the wrong size.
1.0,"Seam has come out. I have washed these approximately 4 times and there is an inch of seam which has come open in the crotch.  I am 82 years old and it is too difficult to package them, then drive the 15 miles (one way) to get to the location which ships them to you, so I will not be returning them.  I hope this is not a problem with the Hanes product time, and that the second pair I bought will hold up better."
1.0,Super sized Bought my normal size and it’s super super sized.  Will not buy again.  Donating to a shelter since it’s a pain to return items
1.0,"Not the same pants I have been buying these pants for several years.  I wear them year round working outside on the farm.  They're warm in the winter and protect my legs in the summer.  This time I bought 2 more pair.  They are not the same pants.  These do not come up to my waist.  The back of the pants are lower than the front...when I bend over, my rear end shows.  Also, they are longer than they used to be...I walk on them now.  Now I'm in the dreaded search for a new pair of pants that actually fit.  I still love my old ones though!!"
1.0,"no pockets, fits too snug I usually have good luck with the Hanes brand, but not with these sweat pants.  Two drawbacks that would keep me from ever buying them again:  no pockets and far, far too tight for the size they are supposed to be.  I'll pass them along to someone else."
1.0,"Poor choice Non working elastic waistband. Have a old pair of Hanes size medium that fit perfect, this pair falls off, the waistband has no stretch. Material is crummy."
1.0,Completely wrong size The size I bought was what was recommended for me.  This item didn’t come close to fitting me.  Unfortunately it would take time and gas in order for me to return it.  So I’ll have to keep it and not buy any other clothes online.  Disappointing
1.0,Do not fit true to size I bought a medium pair and they were so big! I could of fit another body in them!  No more buying clothes on Amazon.
1.0,"Strange Sizing and Fit! I ordered a Large, since I wear a size 14 in pants. I received a Medium and they are HUGE! I think these are a men's cut. The legs are super wide and baggy. The material is thin. They will be ok to wear when cleaning the garage. I am shocked these got such a high rating. Very disappointed in these!"
1.0,"I hate these They're a weird cut, the fabric has no stretch, and they don't have pockets. I got rid of them almost immediately. 0/5 if I could"
1.0,"Buy smaller Bought size according to reviews & a size chart from the brand. They literally fell off of me. I'm 5'10"" & 170-175lbs & bought a large. Would've returned & tried a medium maybe but not available for same price sadly."
1.0,These are huge! I ordered a medium and they are just huge. They don't even fit at the waist. The legs are very wide.  I would not recommend them.
1.0,"Fit I returned them, because they fit straight up and down with no shape to them what so ever."
1.0,Too big and way to long! I am 5'6. When I tried them on they were so long. I washed them in the hopes they would shrink. Usually regular length fits me just right and I never need to have anything altered. I knew something was wrong so I looked at the label and it was a Tall.  Very disappointed. Went back to look at the label on the plasticbag it came in and nowhere did it say tall. I then looked at the original site that I ordered from and they didn't even have tall as an option. Disappointed!wt
1.0,Erratic sizing Other people have also commented on sizing issues but I took and chance and bought a grey pair in small and they fit appropriately. Then I ordered purple in small and it fits like a large which I discovered after washing. Whoever is making these must randomly choose a size to sew
1.0,Too Big!! I’ve ordered these same pants in this s size from this vendor before and they were perfectSo I ordered again. They said Medium but both pair are MASSIVE!  Can’t wear them
1.0,Fabric can be a bit scratchy. The fabric is thicker like sweatpants but the material is not soft and collects pet hair like crazy. The material seems easy to snag. Don't try to cut off the label on the back seam. I did and the seam of mine ripped open the first day I wore them.
1.0,Badly sewn I bought a black pair a few weeks ago and they were fine. This gray pair is badly sewn and should never passed quality control (if there is any). One leg is very obviously longer and wider than the other.
1.0,"Front of waist higher than the back Quality control is terrible. I previously purchased 2 pair of these pants and was pleased with the fit. This time I received 2 pair with clearly flawed sizing. The fit wasn't just bad, its not even wearable."
1.0,Too big I ordered a medium & the waist is too big. Order a smaller size than normal.
1.0,"Not a women’s size, MASSIVE. Don’t recommend. I bought a small and these pants are ginormous. Waist and length. Definitely doesn’t seem like a women’s size small. No drawstring or pockets either. I don’t recommend these."
1.0,"Gets baggie I’ve washed etc can’t get rid of the lint, it looks like rat poop on the floor. It’s not (rat poop) tho"
1.0,"Not as advertised It appears these pants are used. Not only that, but the size small is actually more like a large or extra large. I didn't pay enough for these to return them. But they are thin and very cheap material."
1.0,"Anything but the same... I purchased this in both the light steel (light gray) and slate heather (dark gray) but in the same size. They were anything but the same. Though they were supposedly the same size (M). However, the dark gray pair is longer and about a size too big and the light gray pair is very short and about a size too small. Definitely not the same size or shape. Very disappointed."
1.0,"Lo más importante es comprar una prenda que quede bien . Es demasiado grande para mi mama, ella es gruesita pero no para tanto es muy exagerado el tamaño ."
1.0,Oh My Goddnes a Med ..too large These are soft as they say..and could be very comfortable..but way too baggy..and the leg is 9 1/2 in..across..wide leg oh m goodness way too wide..So when You ordered take all this in consideration..
1.0,"Not worth it Just an awful piece of clothing, so bad Amazon did not want it back, just refunded my account.not a typical product from Hanes"
1.0,"Poor fitting Awful.  Elastic waist was wider than the hip area.  No inside drawstring, so no way to keep them up.  Waste of money."
1.0,"Sweat Pants Buyer beware! These are very cheaply made, had to wash them twice just to get all the fuzz off of them and dryer screen was chucked full of fuzz.  I made the mistake of washing them with other garments and I had a heck of a time getting all the fuzz off the other clothes. Even though these are a Hanes brand, I am very disapointed!"
1.0,"ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE QUALITY, LINT EVERYWHERE, CHEAPLY MADE, POOR FIT Do not buy these.  The insides are FILLED with lint.  I bought black ones.  They got lint all over an entire load of laundry, and I had to clean out my washer and dryer and rewash EVERYTHING after washing these sweatpants.  Even after that I had to use an entire roll of sticky roller to remove the lint from my clothes.  I thought I was going to have to get a dryer repair service to clean out the lint trap and exhaust.  Seriously, buy these at your own risk.  You get what you pay for.  After this experience, I went to Kohl's and bought a pair of Tekgear for about $9 that are awesome, and then I went to TJMaxx and got a pair of Danskins for $20.  Both washed fine and are much better quality. Besides the lint issue, they are poorly constructed and sewn, and the sizing is waaaay off.  I could've fit another person in the pair I ordered, and I ordered a size down.  I'll never buy another Hanes product."
1.0,Legs are huge Legs are much wider and baggier than in the picture.
1.0,Do not buy I would recommend not buying this item.  The material catches every little thing.  It is awful.
1.0,"Size Large?  Label Said Large… These pants were huge. I wear a Medium/size 8 in pants, but I like my ‘slouchy’ pants baggy.  These pants fell off my waist. Also, they are made of much heavier material than expected.  I don’t recommend them."
1.0,TOO BIG I got a size large (my size 12) and was shocked by how big these are! The quality seemed very good but be warned they run very big.
1.0,I ordered them in black and came in blue. They didn't get the color right.  The pants hang like a sack so much for fit.
1.0,Too loose Too large. Too much fuzz
1.0,fit the medium fits like an extra large
1.0,"Odd shape I returned these because they were oddly shaped. They were too wide and too short, even though I ordered my usual size."
1.0,"Caution--not fitted in the waist and ridiculously HUGE The fabric was nice, soft and would have been comfortable and warm. However, the fit was...well ridiculously  huge and strangely distorted. I ordered my normal size and could not keep these on. Literally so huge they slid down.  I looked at the size chart on these for the waist, then measured the waist on the actual pants and it was nine (9) inches bigger. I concluded that the not-very-elastic waist band was actually supposed to fit around my upper hips, but even that didn't work out as they were still ridiculously huge. Given the return shipping charges vs. the inexpensive cost of the pants, it was not worth returning so I donated them with some other things to a homeless shelter where hopefully somebody will be big enough to keep them up. Others have commented on the ""runs large"" sizing so I can't say I wasn't warned, but it never occurred to me just how ""runs large"" these are. So, please note these are truly ridiculously huge."
1.0,"Very Very Large After reading the reviews I knew to order a size down.  I wear a size 12 pants, I ordered a Medium.  These pants were sooooooo big that when I put them on, and stood up, they fell down to my ankles.  The pant legs themselves were so wide I could pull the legs all the way up to my waist."
1.0,These ripped in one wear. They were loose on me. Poorly made They were loose on me so the rip was random af. Poorly made
1.0,Sized Incorrectly I bought 5 pairs of these for my elderly aunt and they were all WAY too big.  I ordered the small petite in 4 of the pairs and accidentally ordered a xxl in the fifth pair.  They are all the same size of the larger pair even though they are labeled as petite small.  She lives in a different state than I do and I had these shipped to her.  She is unable to get out to be able to return them due to health issues and I cannot travel to get them because of distance.  She is now stuck with all of these pants that are WAY too big for her and I am stuck spending even more money to find some that will actually fit her.BEWARE the sizing on these pants is incorrect!!! If I could give them zero stars I would!!!
1.0,"Need a label to print to return this item These pants are way to big and I need to send them back.  I need a label that I can print out and put it on the pkg, I can't use a QR Code because I live remote and don't have a UPS store here.  So please send me a label I can print out."
1.0,"Not pretty The quality has changed since I purchased them a couple of years ago! Not a great fit, I'm sorry that I threw out the packaging and had no choice but wearing two pairs, will NEVER order Habes again!!!"
1.0,"Won't stay up This pants are so annoying. I read the reviews about the waist  being too big so I ordered small. It is still too big and the way they are made, the waist is not high enough and falls down. Not a good fit. So uncomfortable, always trying to pull them up. Don't waste your money on these ."
1.0,"Believe the negative reviews! WIERD sizing!!! Wish I had not taken the chance.  Huge in the waist and short.  A no all the way around.  Im super standard size and can usually make anything work but these went straight back.  Its nice that they are inexpensive, but that doesn't help if they are not even close to fitting."
1.0,"Horrible fit The pants fit very awkwardly, not meant for anyone with any curves ( hips or butt) at all"
1.0,Frumpy panta Acceptable work in the yard sweats if that’s what you’re looking for. No drawstring. Large size was too long and too baggy.  Type of sweat pant  I would not even wear around my kids. The definition of frumpy for ladies.
1.0,These are extremely large. XL is not the correct label. These are more like 3X. What a disappointment. I bought 4 for my mom on Black Friday and now they cost more to order smaller ones.
1.0,"Don't know how this got Amazon's top pick I ordered these pants because I needed some new sweat pants.  These came highly rated on the internet in an article so I ordered two pair, based on reviews on size. First, the $7.50 price isn't consistent across the board for all colors, which is stupid. These pants have NO drawstring, tie or elastic in the waist like every other pair of sweats I've ever ordered or had so they are not adjustable in any way.  And the length on the large is so short. Above the top of my shoes. Even if I were to wash them in hot water to try to shrink the waist the length would come up and they'd look like capris, and probably still be too big in the waist.  I'm going to try to return them. If they won't take them back, well, I guess I'll donate them to a church clothing drive. The only star I gave them was because they did ship quickly. That was the only good thing about this purchase."
1.0,I should have known better When the price is good I should think twice.  They didn't have pockets & they shrunk. So after I wearing & wash they went in my donation box.
1.0,"never again I bought these due to the positive reviews. I must be missing something as these left a lot to be desired. First, they were super soft on the inside, but they left black fuzz balls of lint all over my house. Literally everywhere I walked. This happened until I washed them three times - after that, it slowed a bit. I sized up as I wanted a looser fit, but the waist is so big, they almost fall down. I am 5'9 and they are too short on me - I don't like them. After the first wash, there was a hole in the middle of the knee - nowhere near a seam, just a hole. There was no reason for a hole to be there as there wasn't anything that could have caused this damage by me or my washer. Strangest thing. I would not buy these again, no matter how cheap they are. You get what you pay for."
1.0,Sizing is off big time I bought a small. The pants are huge but the waistband is the widest part. They're not cut right at all. My 13 year old and I could probably both fit in these pants at the same time if we tried. It is almost as if someone stretched the crap out of the top of the pants before selling them. Don't waste your money.
1.0,The sizing is very large. These sweatpants are very large.  I ordered a small but they fit larger than a large.
1.0,"Too large. Awkward fit. While the product is soft and comfortable, the fit could have been more pleasing and manageable. I returned these pants."
1.0,Nor as expected I bought these for a quick trip and they were not as specified. They look like old lady pants and are short and tight
1.0,It was way to big and I ordered a petite and go a tall  . I take a large or xl it looked like a 3x It was so large it could fit a 3x  person and x tall ?
1.0,NO POCKETS! I’m 5’5” and 127 lbs.  I ordered a size small. These pants fit me fine (to the roomy side but not sloppy big).  My issue is that they had no pockets.  I have to have pockets!  I returned these but only because of the pocket issue.
1.0,"Pants run larger than your size These pants were way to loose around the waist and way to baggy on the bottom of the legs. I always fit in this size, so it was like a larger size."
1.0,They were twice as big as listed measurement Huge!!! Bigger than a men’s large!
1.0,WAY TOO BIG!!!!!! Just plain baggy pants I could stitch together in 10 minutes with fabric from Joann's. Run SUPER BIG!
1.0,"Horrible!! Don't Buy!! Never ending lint and fuzz everywhere, have to wash separately. Horrible piling in thighs from the first wear. Seam on waist and butt started unraveling after first wash. Unflattering and awkward fit. Design or construction is flawed and feels uncomfortably backwards. Front of pants sits higher and fits looser than the back side. Can't sit or bend over without showing some skin, while at the same time the front stays up way above my waist and with room to spare, so awkward. If my butt were in the front, they might actually fit. I even tried wearing them ""backwards"" just in case the tag was sewn in wrong, but that feel right either. Could be a design flaw or a manufacture's flaw, either way, these are the worst sweatpants I've ever owned, so buyer beware."
1.0,Wore them for an hour and they ripped right in the REAR in PUBLIC The picture speaks for itself
1.0,Odd shape They were too wide and too short. I returned them.
1.0,Order 2-3 sizes smaller if you must buy them I read reviews that said to order one size smaller. So I ordered a small instead of medium. What I got in the mail were pants that were gigantic. When held in front of my body to the floor they are almost my body height. I thought well maybe I can just cut off length to make them fit. But nope. They are big in the waist also. I was able to pull them up to my shoulders.These size small pants are so big I could cut the inside leg seams sew the legs together and make these into a sleeping bag. Point being I do not recommend these pants.
1.0,Very disappointed. Does not fit like in the picture. The leg opening could fit my waist. They are humongous. You trip when you walk. Waist size seemed to run large too. I purchased two colors and returned both.
1.0,Too loose The pants fit perfectly at first but after a couple of hours they were too loose at the waist. If these pants had a drawstring they would be great. I ended up throwing them away after one use. Definitely a waste of money.
1.0,"Women's xlarge means short and wide The fabric is the kind that attracts static, the waist is too wide and the legs too long. Nice color though"
1.0,"Strange fit! These are not drawstring as advertised, are too short (I'm 5'6"") and barely come up over my hip bones. Unfortunately, I have already washed and cannot return!"
1.0,"Legs not the same length! I purchased two pair of these pants.  Loved them except the right leg on both pair was longer than the left.  There was a noticeable difference.  One pair was 1 1/4"" shorter and the other 1 1/2"" shorter.  I would have used them for lounge pants but the leg length was considerably different.  I just got these pants less than a month ago but they said I ordered them last year.  I would have liked to have them as they were advertised, but I guess I can make shorts out of them."
1.0,"not good material was way too thin, and huge bell bottoms,  not good at all"
1.0,Pant not good. Material is not good so do not buy this pant. Pant not good. Material is not good so do not buy this pant.
1.0,"Buyer beware I like the softness of these sweatpants. I ordered a Medium which is my normal size. These are HUGE. Why do the sizes of clothes these days vary so much!? I am scared of ordering a Small, they may be huge too. Per the reviews this is often the case. I was pleased they are not made in China, but made in Guatemala. I would have been extremely happy if they were American made and fit properly. Beware."
1.0,Runs LARGE Ordered Small - they just fell off!
1.0,"NOT the relaxed, comfy sweatpants I wanted ☹️ These pants were not at ALL what I sought.Based on the reviews that described them as running very large, I ordered my usual size, XL, and the pants literally would not go onto my body.I wanted loose, comfortable, cozy sweatpants to wear around the house on cold days, and these are ""skinny"" pants, with a wide, low-riding waistband, no pockets, and essentially no stretch. They were a complete fail for me.Unfortunately I didn't keep the packaging, or I'd return them.As it is, I guess my feral cats will be sleeping on them.Do NOT choose these if you want comfortable, relaxed sweatpants!"
1.0,Grey Sweats Were way too big even though I ordered a medium
1.0,"I ordered suggested size, that were humongous. They were humongous,  couldn't keep them up. Legs were like ballons."
1.0,Way to large Cant wear them to large.
1.0,larger than anticipated Product is much larger than stated. Items being returned.
1.0,"WAY too big! I ordered a size small. These pants are anything but small! The size chart says these are 28.5 - 29.5"" at the waist. They are not. I measured them, and they are 37"". ""Runs large"" is an understatement."
1.0,They are not Safe ze Small. I’m a size 4 and short. They are like size 1 and very long ng Way too Big
1.0,It’s so big that it falls off of me and that makes me walk on the bottoms!  Very disappointing! It’s so big that it falls off my waist! I can’t wear them anymore!
1.0,"The fit Too big, should of tagged them xxl, they were too big"
1.0,"The outside of the pants pill really bad, quickly The outside of the pants pill quickly"
1.0,"Good Grief Reviews said these ran large, but the Amazon order page gave me ""my correct size.""  After much wavering, I went with the suggested size, and these could hold TWO of me.  Further, there is no drawstring, so no hope to recover.  I'm considering opening the band  in the front somehow (the only seam on the band is in the back) to try to run a drawstring through or shorten the elastic.  Then perhaps I might be able to at least sleep in them.  What a headache."
1.0,"Inconsistent sizing between colors in the same size, in addition to running large generally. Inconsistent sizing within the ‘size’, in addition to running large generally.  Initially purchased dark steel in small (normally wear 8-10) and it’s a loose fit but okay for lounging so decided to get two more but in different colors: light steel and navy heather.  Light steel waist is 1” smaller than the dark steel and thus actual fits well; legs are 1/2” shorter but ok.  Navy heather however is much too big, waist is 1” larger than the dark steel, hence 2” larger than the light steel; and the legs are 1.5” longer."
1.0,Really  disappointed  with this order These pant are too big am loss in it have to do a refund on return
1.0,"Ordered a 2x, fits like 4x.. Sizing is inaccurate AND no drawstring? Hanes, you've slipped too low, like these terrible sweatpants."
1.0,"Really awkward Fit is very awkward. Elastic waistband is weak, pooches at the belly. Feels like I'm about to be pants'd at any moment. Not very soft."
1.0,"Don't fit to big Kinda disappointed with this item. First of all I ordered a small and seems to appear that the size small is a size Medium. The elastic was stretched out so gone to try to replace the elastic with new elastic. Color I chosen is perfect. Down fall of the item they are made for taller person not a small person as I am ""5 ft."" I rated a two star b/c of the elastic problem.I ordered a size small for that is what I have always wear when ordering pants or sweats. I have to do a lot of alterations to them. I didn't order this item to have to work on them. So if ordering a small if you wear a small remember this, may have to order a petite small either a size up or a size down all depends on what you usual wear and your usual size. The elastic is not that great it seem to appear the elastic was stretch out."
1.0,"Too large! Very unflattering. I wanted them to be loose and big, but these were super big, long, and very wide."
1.0,"Small is Not Small The small is not small, they are too big and they fall down.  I'm bummed these are useless for me, I'm going to donate them."
1.0,Not fit Return
1.0,Didn’t fit. Too large
1.0,Fit Run very big
1.0,So disappointed Ordered 4 pair and this pair came 2sizes bigger then the rest but still says it’s a size medium
1.0,To Large They were so large it was like 4x instead of XLarge
1.0,4'' too long and short in crouch and to big in waste Had to give a way way too big for a petite small !!!
1.0,"Didn't last 2 months When I first got the pants I was happy, even though they were inexpensive I expected better quality from a well known brand. I received the pants on Nov 30th and by January 4th they are already ripping on the seam between the legs, that's a month and a week after purchase.  Very disappointed in this product and in the brand. I'm so upset I just missed the return deadline by a few days. I would've returned this useless pants."
1.0,They look like a mans size they fit my husband so said Horrible
1.0,No drawstring This products is advertised with a drawstring and it  does not. I wouldn't have order these had I known this upfront.
1.0,A mess Pants to short and wide
1.0,Inaccurate description These are not drawstring as indicated in the description.
1.0,Don't fit. At least six inches too long.
1.0,"Transparent These are thin and see through. Not a ‘sweat pant’. Also, not flattering at all."
1.0,"Beware - These run huge Purchased these in Large but they fit like a XXL!  I assumed they would fit comfortably for a 34"" waist but these fall down.  Seen things like this on the street but that's definitely not my style.  I prefer something a little more snug.No problems with returning them but disappointing that these run several sizes too large."
1.0,XL was WAY TOO BIG I wear an xl in pants…. There was room for another person in these pants!
1.0,"Poor quality These sweatpants are soft and warm, which I really liked. Unfortunately that’s the only think I liked about this product. They are a bit long, which was expected as I have pretty short legs and they don’t sell petite sizes. They are not good for wearing outside the house because they pick up a ton of grass and leaves. I was also really disappointed in the quality— the material wears out really fast and the stitching came apart after only two months. The inside of the sweatpants leaves little blue residue all over you even after I washed them multiple times. Overall not worth it— just bite the bullet and spend a little more money to get more a better quality product."
1.0,"I ordered 2 pairs and they don't fit the same. I ordered 2 of the same color and size and one pair is way too small. while the other fits. problem being that I didn't discover the problem til it was too late to return cuz I was only wearing the first ones and had put away the second for later. big mistake! you can't count on companies using the same chart but it is pretty bad when the same company has the same size fitting differently., in this case medium. if I was to buy from others I wear an xl! This industry has gone to hell in a hand basket along with the rest of the world."
1.0,"Way too big! I ordered these before and the fit perfect, so I ordered 3 more however all 3 were too big in the waist. Size small"
1.0,Not petite. Unflattering Not petite in any sense. I ordered a small.  I’m 5’1 and 130 pounds. They are really long and the waist is super wide with no drawstring.  I’m a mom of 2 with hips and a butt and they still won’t fit. If you are a very slender petite these definitely won’t fit at all. I will keep to wear during my time of the month to sleep only because I ordered in black. Would never wear these even to market due to how unflattering. Looks and fits nothing like stock photo.
1.0,"Very wrong on the size chart. The sizing chart for this is so off it is humorous. Hilarity ensued in my home this evening after they arrived this morning. I ordered a medium, being 5'6"" and 123 pounds, and going on their recommended waist size (didnt want super tight comfy wear)....they showed up and there is no way that these things will ever stay on with as large as they are. I will say, however, that my husband, who is a mens size large in his sweats fit in them, with room to grow in the waist. (He is 5'11"" and 202 pounds). But! At 7.00 a pair, and winter is here in new england, they will be a nice donation to the goodwill as clearly they will never fit me or my husband."
1.0,"They run HUGE. They run really large & theres no way to tighten them up.--Really nice sweatpants but they run really big for me, I bought a large so I don't know if a med or a small would fit. Not going to the trouble sending them back, will just give them to my Son ---Hopefully they will work for him, if not I'll find someone else to give them to.B.R."
1.0,my daughter normally wears a medium but this product was too large i Your medium sized sweat pant which was a gift for my daughter for her birthday was too large.
1.0,"These pants are awful. Too short, material feels lousy and turned my socks black! Do not buy! Lousy all around, nothin good to say! Returning!!"
1.0,"The waist is 31in.It should be 28.5-29.5”according to the size chart. DO NOT this pant. I will give it zero stare. According to the size chart,size M waist should be 28.5-29.5”. But when I received the pant ,before the elastic  stretching,the waist is 31”.I bought two pairs for my wife, I have to return. DO NOT BUY!!!"
1.0,"This are horrendous - you will HATE them! I am a person that dislikes returning things, so I'll usually try to make do with what I've ordered.  But there's no way I could keep these.  Unless I was 5'10 and homeless, I wouldn't like them.  (I'm 5'6).  And, I have a large waistline compared to most people, but these were LOOSE around the waist for me.  The most disgusting thing though was that they were flare leg or almost like a wide bell-bottom pant!!!  I would have had to hem them, and then I would still be embarrassed wearing them with the wide legs.  Don't waste your money!!!!!  I really can't imagine ANYONE liking these."
1.0,"Way too big I wear a large normally in sweat pants.  These were so big they just fell right down. They also seemed to be a lot shorter than what the web site stated.  I didn't measure the inseam but I know where a 31in inseam should be on me. I had to return them, couldn't even keep them as lounge around the house pants."
1.0,To Say They Run Large is an Understatement Ordered a “small petite”. They are NOT small and they are NOT petite even though size label indicates such. Quality control must have been asleep when these came down the line. Ordered for my size 4 daughter. I am a size 12 and they fit me fine so I’m going to keep. I’ll just have to go to my local discount merchant where I can see what I’m buying first.
1.0,Huge They are huge
1.0,"Rear Seam Tore Over 6"" During 1st Use Like so many others here, I needed comfy pants. I wasn't expecting much, just something to in which to lounge and run errands. I wore them for the first time today, and went out running errands. After returning home, I changed clothes. When I took off the pants, I was shocked! The rear seam had torn from the halfway point of the tag to a couple inches above the crotch. I never felt it, and no one either noticed or bothered to tell me. These pants, although disappointing in performance, were good for a great laugh. They also run about two sizes large and feel pretty cheap on the skin."
1.0,Yuck! This product is terribly made and doesn't fit well at all.
1.0,Too long and way to wide Too long and too wide and not what I expected
1.0,"La talla no corresponde Es demasiado grande ,ni siquiera se puede arreglar"
1.0,"Won't order again! Ordered size I always wear, but way too long for me (and I'm tall.)  And, legs are big and baggy."
1.0,Just to skinny To skinny in legs
1.0,"Different colors fit differently I purchased the same size pants in black and purple.  While neither pair fits as I would like, the black feels like it is a size smaller than the purple. The sizing leaves a lot to be desired, but for the price, the purple will do."
1.0,"Update on the Hanes Eco-sport sweat pants Update to my order:  I received the new sweat pants and they are perfect.  They are very comfortable and cozy.May order another color.Unfortunately these sweat pants were way way too large, like I got a XXX not the XL I ordered so I can not give answers to all the questions...  I have reordered these sweat pants in a L so will see how that goes...  The pant themselves were nice, soft and a good weight .  Really liked the color so hopefully the new ones that are coming will fit as they should."
1.0,"Quality Control Issue Disappointed. I ordered the Navy Medium in 12/2020, but it was much too large. Soon after (in 1/2021) I ordered the Navy Small in exact same style to replace, but fabric is significantly thinner (poorer quality) and waist is a full inch LARGER than the waist on Medium I'd ordered. Going to give replacing the Small one final try in hopes that I receive sweatpants with the better fabric thickness and proper size.(Note that a few years ago I received a Medium size cotton-poly, open-bottom sweatpants by Hanes, which fit well and was better quality, with drawstring.)"
1.0,Very odd waist band I was hesitant to buy these because it said petite in the description. I’m 5’10” 190. I am not petite. But with that being said the length was fine. They fit fine through the hips. BUT these have the oddest waist band I’ve seen it’s a wide band slides right off your butt. And like I said I’m curvy. They didn’t stay on me at all. If it wasn’t for the waist band I’d like them. Usually a waist band is smaller than the width of the hips it was just as wide.
1.0,Not happy I bought these for a last minute trip and they came right before I left. I was definitely disappointed in the material and the fit. They were very thin and not very soft. They also fit loose. I would have returned then if I had any other option
1.0,"Odd fit I so badly wanted to like these especially at this price! Looking for a pair of sweatpants that don't really look like sweat pants so I opted for these. The fit was just so...odd. Almost like the design did not take into account that people have a behind. The length seemed ok, but hard to tell as the waist didn't sit right and hips seemed all sorts of baggy because of it. I even thought I might have had them on backwards but when I tried them on in reverse, they fit EXACTLY THE SAME... almost too high in the front, and barely covering my backside. Such a shame."
1.0,Brought the large buy to shot in the torso To short in torso
1.0,"way too big Im usually a size Small/Medium but since the reviews said it runs large i decided to go with the smallest size which was a small. im 5’7 and around 110 pounds, this falls off of my waist & i genuinely believe i could fit into this twice. If you’re on the smaller side i wouldn’t recommend you buying it unless you can or know someone that can adjust it for you."
1.0,"Oddly cut I'm not sure who these are made for, but they have a very strange fit, especially compared to other Hanes bottoms. They are VERY short, very thin, and the butt to waist area fits like an ill-fitting diaper.  But seriously, the fabric feels so chinsy it would just fall apart in the wash."
1.0,HUGE! HORRIBLE PURCHASE My daughter bought with her own Amazon card she received on her 12th birthday. They were so big!!! They were like a 3xl in the waist and she ordered a small!!
1.0,"Terrible fit I ordered a large, because it says to order next size down, & I normally wear an x-large, the waist was huge, & if you have a rump, these won't cover it. I'll have to alter these & give to my mom, who is smaller than me, then at least I can make them fit her rump."
1.0,Way to Big They are three sizes too big.
1.0,Xl parece 3x Terrible
1.0,very little stretch and completely gone after one wash. not great
1.0,"They don't fit anywhere! These pants are not built for anyone with any kind of bum or a waist. They are practically the same if you wear them backward. Huge around the waist, tight across the bum, and the waistband doesn't go up over my bum. No pockets. No drawstring.  Going back for sure!"
1.0,Gross! These fit very low on the hip and the legs are huge.  They are so low on the hip they won't stay up.  The fabric is light weight for a sweat pant and it's only slightly brushed on the inside.  The pants drag the ground they are so long.  The pants are wide cut all the way to the ground which makes me look very dumpy. I can also smell the dye chemicals they used.  So disappointing - I expected more from this brand name.
1.0,suppose to be a small size Maybe it would bit a small giant.  It was way too big all over.  I normally wear a small but they should have a XS if they are going to make them this baggy!
1.0,Not petite at all and huge If you are size 8 or below then not even a small will fit you.  It says petite but the length is super long as well.  I am not that petite and can wear most regular length pants and it way long.  Maybe it would shrink when washed though.
1.0,"Cheap looking :( Very sad at the quality of these pants. I wore them once, washed them, and now the internal fleece is all over my house and there is bobbling at the inner thigh. My thighs do touch but they’ve never created this kind of bobbling before, especially after only one wear! I also think the leg vs hip rise ratio is a little off, at least for a pear shaped lady.The first time I wore them, they looked like comfortable work pants...after laundering they looked like cheap fleece pants. They were cheap so I get it, they’re comfortable, but I’ll be using them indoors only."
1.0,"not as ordered I ordered two pair of the Eco Smart sweatpants.  Price was very low.  Well, I guess that's because the blue one was not the Eco Smart, it was Comfort Band.  So, it doesn't fit me right, the waist is too high.  I liked the Eco Smart because the rise was exactly right for me.  I'm not sure if I'll bother sending them back, because I'm not kidding about how cheap they were.  But it's very not nice to send something different than what the customer ordered."
1.0,"Quality is horrible! Love the way they fit. However, This is my second time buying these. The first pair got holes after wearing the pants for about a year. The second lair were delivered with holes. It's really a shame, because they are so comfy and amazing....they just don't hold up very well."
1.0,"Mislabeled/sizes not correct. WAY to big. Good quality but much too big.  I checked the label twice, thinking I had received the wrong size.  Go AT LEAST one size smaller.  There isn’t a smaller size for me to exchange these for so I washed and dried them hoping they would shrink... nope.  I’m stuck with sweats that fall down :/I gave a one star review because these are definitely mis-sized or mis-labeled and I can’t return or exchange.  Another company I’d give 3 or 4 stars but Hanes can do better."
1.0,Way oversized and the petite I ordered too long for a tall person! Price was good but the fit was terrible.  I accidentally ordered petite but what I received would be too long on a tall person. The waist is huge and the crotch and belly sags. I ordered a large which is what I typically wear. I think a small would be too large!
1.0,"Major stains, Used Condition, WAY Too Large Anyway Came next to, not in, the plastic bag with the sku sticker, and bag was torn open, suggesting it was a return someone sent back and when I bought it it was sent on to me. Adding to that impression was the giant black stains on the waistband. Ew! Not that these sweatpants would have fit anyway. They are ridiculously huge. I wear XS or S and these would have fit like a L. Bad experience and would not buy anything else from this seller. Got refunded immediately upon contacting Amazon."
1.0,"I think the tag had to be WRONG I am petite/5'2"" tall and usually get a size 14. So... according to this I should get a large. These were 6"" to long and so baggy they would almost fall off. The description was:""Hanes Women's Petite EcoSmart Open Bottom Leg Sweatpants, Light Steel, Large""Definitely NOT petite!"
1.0,"Pilling on the first use! See pic. I just received these today and I was excited as I bought the matching sweatshirt. So I have a real sweatsuit outfit for around the house. However, as you can see in the picture of my inside thigh, it already pilled! There is a lot of pilling in both thighs. So, I can see these will not last our quarantine period, let alone the entire pandemic! The waist is very loose, so I had to tuck the band, it would have been nice to have drawstrings. I do not recommend."
1.0,Holy Sweatpants! These sweat pants say Hanes brand but they are far from the Hanes brand I know of. These are cheap made. And XL came in and would of been way too loose on my 6'2 230lb husband. Way way way too big. And xl is more like a 4X
1.0,"Not a good fit at all I find myself at the stage where ""comfy"" pants are preferred most days.  These pants were a great price for a well known brand, but they did not fit me in any way.  I am 5'4'' and 135 pounds with a fuller stomach and thighs. These pants were huge at the waist and too long.  When I tried to gather them up to see if I could alter them to fit, they got too tight in the crotch/rear.  Pants should fit at the true waist.  Better elastic is needed.  Pockets would be a huge plus."
1.0,Do not recommend This pants is way too big and fade.
1.0,"Mens fit These were a terrible fit, like mens pants!  I tried the medium and they fit my 36"" waist size husband.  The small was still too big and yet was a very uncomfortable fit.  I figured out it's because they are straight down through the hips and they fit on my waist in a strange place as well as being way too long.  I'm 5'6"", and they had fabric bunched up on the ground.  They fit my 5'10"" son with a 33"" waist.  They were also very hot to wear."
1.0,"Not true to size. These run huge! I returned a M for a S and they are still huge. Even rolling the waist band over doesn't help. I  had no choice at the time - needed for physical therapy. Now they're in my ""to be donated"" bag;"
1.0,Not true to size Thought these would fit as shown in the picture. I ordered a large so they would be a little loose for comfy fit but what I received must've been an XL or XXL marked as a L. WAY too big. Length was good. Pant leg itself was massive as well as waist. Should have went with a M for comfy fit and S for fitted. Was super bummed as I needed these for an event and had to rush to find something else.
1.0,"Way too large for the "" large "" size. I won't bother sending it back as it is too much of a hassle but those pants are extremely large . I like to wear a Large to be be comfortable but those are more like XL  ( if not XXL ) .  The ""  Large  "" size is huge , in every way. Way too wide, way too long, I can't wear it and it will end up torn up to use as rags I guess."
1.0,"Not Sized Correctly As noted in reviews, I ordered a size smaller and when it arrived I found I should have ordered 3 sizes smaller!  The Large was like a XXL or XXXL.  Material is also thinner than I thought it would be.  I didn't bother returning but I will only wear the pants as VERY roomy PJ bottoms.  I wouldn't be caught dead in them out in public.  I''m hoping they shrink a lot in the wash."
1.0,"Sizing chart incorrect I ordered 2 pair, using the size chart as guideline.  They fell off of me.  The material is nice, but not what I had in mind for sweatpants.  Will attempt to return, but due to health issues, may not be able to."
1.0,"Very soft pants, fit as expected Pants fit just as expected. Very soft material. However, first time wearing I noticed the seam coming apart at the ankle.Update: washed once and third time wearing them. The crotch has completely come apart. Very poor quality."
1.0,Immediate Peeling The inner thighs started to peel during the first wear which was less than 7 hours.
1.0,Very Large I would consider this fit an XXL. Legs are very wide also. I thought they would work since I usually wear a size 12. Wanted them somewhat larger for comfort but I wouldn't even be able to keep them up.
1.0,Supposed to have a drawstring it did not Pant was supposed to have a drawstring. My mom has lost some weight and it did not have one. Disappointed
1.0,"Waaaaay too big. I ordered a “Petite Small” and not only could I fit TWO of me in the pants, they were too big for my husband to wear!! They are being donated to charity- but for someone who takes an extra-large. I was really looking forward to wearing these, but I wouldn’t even try another item from this brand."
1.0,"Size SMALL is HUGE! I have the sweatshirt and wanted the matching pants so badly! It is warm and I love the color! So, when I found the pants on amazon I was very excited! When they arrived I was amazed at how HUGE they are. Even with the waist band rolled over they were so large they’d slide down. I ordered a size Small! They are Enormous! There is no extra small size available, which is very disappointing. I want this set!"
1.0,"Poor sizing, A small is more like an extra large It states to order one size smaller that they’re bigger than usual I am in between a small and medium and the smallest size was small so I ordered it. When it arrived I put them on and it was much more like an XL then it was a small. And it said small on the package and small on the tag on the insideFor the price I wound up donating to charity"
1.0,"Each roll said, ""Dollhouse"" on the label instead of, ""ScotTissue""! I like realistic miniature products. On these, the tissue labels all read, ""Dollhouse"". All the other competitors that I've seen and bought are labeled, ""ScotTissue"". For that alone, I give them one star! Look closely before you buy."
1.0,Had three days. Worn two of those days. Already has a huge hole I got these pants Saturday and wore them around the house Sunday and Monday. This morning I discovered the crotch seam has come open and there’s a massive hole in the new pants. I can’t believe this. Do not buy.
1.0,Pilled on the first wearing Not impressed... or maybe I am.  How did Hanes manage to tank their quality so thoroughly with this product?  One regular wash and wear and the inner thighs pilled.  Subsequent was and wears and the pills were omnipresent.  I used to be able to rely on this brand.  So sad.
1.0,Comfy but they shed black fuzz everywhere The black fuzzy lining in these pants comes out the bottom when I'm walking and leaves black fuzzies all.over my floor.  Do not buy.  They are sooo comfortable but the amount of shedding is crazy.  I have hardwood floors and they are covered in black fuzz after wearing these pants for a few hours.  I washed and dried them before I wore them.  I wish I could return but I've already washed and wore them.
1.0,No drawstring No drawstring
1.0,"Size varies some are short and some are lo g. I ordered 3 colors for winter. The grey pair is shorter than petite and my ankles are cold with air blowing up the short legs. The purple pair is long, I mean a 6 foot person could wear them.  The blue pair seem to be cut right.  Yes these are not expensive and intended for home wear, but the difference in the same size pant is. . . Well not what I expected."
1.0,"These are huge and sag and bag i read the reviews and bought a size smaller, should have gone 2 sizes smaller maybe a child's size?  Had to take them up in the waist.  but after a couple of hours the knees become huge and they are about 3 inches too long.  They are extremely wide legged.  Made well but doesn't do much good to be made well when its lousy material and sizing."
1.0,"I love the fleece lining so decided to order another small ... I bought 4 of these in total- first one was a medium black but it was so big I decided to purchase another one- but in small & blue. I'm normally a medium size. I love the fleece lining so decided to order another small in black, which came 3-4 inches larger than the blue one. Thinking it was a mistake, I exchange it for another small black one and it too was 3-4"" too big.  Is it just the black ones that are too large?  What a pain, so only 1 fits right out of 4."
1.0,Size is way bigger I think the given size chart is not accurate. I ordered medium petite but this is WAY TOO big for me. I ordered before here in amazon a sweat pant and i also chose medium which said in their chart that medium is 10 and its fit so perfect. I have to refund this coz there is no way i can use this unless you replace this and ill return the item. Im trying to find whom i can contact to this.
1.0,"Cheap material and ripped seam When I first received these pants, my first impression was that the material felt cheap. It’s rough on the outside, but it is soft on the inside. Upon trying them on, they fit much larger than expected in the waist. Length is good. The worst part is the quality. The seam is ripped at the bottom, as shown in the photo. I will be returning these."
1.0,"Would not wear them in public Weirdest fitting sweatpants I’ve ever owned. I needed them for athletic purposes but they’re so terrible in fit, that I decided to keep them to lounge in or paint in, but that’s about it. They won’t be worn in public. Weird flare-leg style but loose everywhere so they feel like elephant ear style pants. I wear a L in just about everything and could literally order these in a small and be fine."
1.0,Too fuzzy Too much fuzz comes off them
1.0,"UUUUGE! I wear a large in just about everything. 12-14 range. I could have literally fit two of me in these things. These don't ""run large"", they are on some completely different scale. I'd have called these at least XX-Large. I don't want to fool with trial and error. I'm afraid a medium is too large, but ordering a small seems like asking for trouble. Hanes needs to re-tag every last one of these."
1.0,"BEWARE: You will be charged for return shipping costs. These pants are crazy HUGE! I’m 5’9” and 125lbs. I ordered a size small and there is no way, I can wear these. The waist is ginormous.I tried to return them for a refund, but the return shipping costs more than the pants. So I’m stuck.I wouldn’t have ordered from this third-party purveyor, had I known I’d be charged for return shipping. Bad experience."
1.0,"SMALL IS NOT SMALL I ordered 2 pair of these last week for my mother.I used your charts to get her size.  We went with medium.... they were huge.  I ordered 2 more, this time we ordered small sizes.  They seem to be at least as large as the first 2.(1 was chewed by the dog before we got them).Do you even make these pants in small?"
1.0,"Not For Anyone with Curves Ordered my usual size in lounge and active wear (M as I’m an 8) and it was huge. Reordered the smaller size (S) and it’s still a bad fit- too wide in the waist with an annoying pooch in the abdominal area, yet the hip and thigh area is just right. These were cut straight as if women don’t have curves. I’m normally proportioned and have very average curves. Length is okay (I’m 5’ 8”) and fabric was decent quality but the cut is sooo uncomfortable."
1.0,RUN HUGE. NO DRAWSTRING. These sweatpants run three times larger than what they should be. They are not the correct sizes for the USA. I ordered a 2X it's more like a 5X.I could fit two of my fat a$$es is in there!! I suggest you buy two sizes less. Also there is no drawstring in the waist. I thought they would be as most sweatpants have them. But the quality seemed okay especially for the price it's too bad.
1.0,To big These pants run extremely large. I originally bought the size large. I could have put two of me in them. So I ordered a small and they were still so loose I had to continually pull them up.
1.0,"Huge! Do NOT buy these pants. Even if you are nine months pregnant they might not stay up. I ordered a medium and they literally fell right down. I don’t know why I wrongly believed these sweats had a drawstring waist. They don’t. On a bright note, the fabric seemed nice. Perhaps if you typically wear a Medium, an extra small might work."
1.0,"Material is not what I expected If you have sensory issues with certain fabrics like me, here is your warning. The inside of the pants have a cotton type fleece material and of course those are one of the materials that I can not touch. I made sure before I bought them there were no mention of fleece and yet it came and here we are."
1.0,"Poor quality Just received these pants and when I tried them on, I was very happy with them.Now I tried to wear them for the day and found a hole between the legs. Waste of money"
1.0,Very disappointed that they did not fit and now I can’t return them Said that this item runs large so I ordered a smaller size and it is too tight. I did not realize it until I was already on vacation and just try them on this past week. Now it’s too late for me to return them. Very disappointed
1.0,"Would not buy again Initially the only problem was the fit around my butt, it was a little tight and I don't have a big butt. I figured I could stretch it out no problem. However, after only wearing it ones (working from home and walking my dog) then washing them, its not worth the cost. They shrunk, there is lint stuck between the legs. I expected this after several washes, not pleased."
1.0,"Way too big. Size chart inaccurate. The size chart says size small should be for waist sizes 28.5-29.5. I measured it and the waist is actually 34 inches. I have to roll the band up twice for it to not fall off my bum, and even then it still falls off. I’m going to attempt to shrink these in the wash, but this was basically a waste of my money."
1.0,Poor quality elastic around the waist There is only elastic at the waist. No drawstrings which I did see before I purchased. The problem is that it is very poor elastic and does not hold the pants up very well.
1.0,"Inexpensive for good reason These sweatpants look more like straight legs in the advertisement picture, but actually flare out much more at the ankle.  It’s like they used a totally different pare on the model, not surprised; I think that is typical with Amazon.  I am disappointed but they are comfy and for $7.50 I will keep them and only wear then around the house"
1.0,"pills badly The pants fit well and are comfortable. What I don't like is that they pill very badly. Any place that rubs at all, such as the seat and the knee/thigh area are covered in pills. I can wear this to work around the house but I would never wear it in public. Very disappointed in the Hanes product."
1.0,Waistband has no stay power. The waistband  has no stay power. After 5 minutes the pants were slipping down. I waded and put through the dryer hoping it would shrink a bit but it did not. I will have to put elastic in the waste to just wear to do lawn work. I can no longer use them for anything else!
1.0,WAAAAAAY to big I ordered a Large.... it fell off my body and I am usually a XL. Can not speak to the product quality as I am not able to wear. Return was a breeze
1.0,"It looks like the description has been changed now I give this one star because of my experience, not the product. It looks like the description has been changed now, but it originally said these were petite which are very hard to find. I was so excited that I bought 2 pair. When I got them they were no where near being petite. Went back on amazon to make sure I was correct that they were supposed to be petite. Sure enough they still said petite. I ordered an exchange and got the same exact thing. So, if you are looking for petite, do not buy these! They also run big."
1.0,"Strange fit I bought a grey and navy pair. Baggy through the legs, could live with that. It was a short crotch area and very uncomfortable. I donated."
1.0,"Terrible quality Terrible quality! These sweatpants pilled the second time I wore them. They are loose on me but somehow the seam on the back of the butt ripped or came loose, I never saw anything like it. The way these are going I think I only have about 2 months of wear before they completely fall apart. Spend a little more money if you’re looking for quality sweatpants."
1.0,Not the best Material or size I didn't like the material on the inside is terrible. Once you put it on the cotton material sticks on you. Once you take it off the cotton material from the inside it falls all over the place and makes a mess. The size of it was too big and it didn't comfortable at all.  100%  Don't recommend.
1.0,They are much larger than size indicates. Incorrectly sized. I usually wear an a large but ordered an large because it said item ran large. When I received the items I couldn't wear because waist was more like a 3 or 4x size.
1.0,"Unwearable I bought 3 smalls for myself and two friends. They were so huge we could not wear them. There isn't even a drawstring to tie them and hold them up. We each gave them away to friends that would be able to fit them. Needless to say, they were so happy they fit into a small!"
1.0,Awful These pants are the worse I've ever purchased. I guess you get what you pay for. After two wears they were pilled up terribly. They shrank a LOT after just one wash. The fit was extremely awkward - the waistband was far too big but the length was too short. Everything about them was wrong.
1.0,They run very small. I went by the size chart with height and weight and it said I was a medium. I am usually an extra large. I added pounds and the chart still said medium. I said oh well let me try them. I couldn’t get them up past my legs to my waist. The quality was nice but sizing is very off.
1.0,"Way too large!! They don't fit! I should've read the reviews before buying. I usually wear a size 8 which would be medium. These pants are large or extra-large. One of them fell to the floor after I put them on. Don't know what I'll do with with them because it is too much trouble  to return. I could've done with a extra small! I bought three, one almost fits. I'm going to try to shrink it in hot water and hot dryer. I am disappointed, as I wanted to replace some of my old sweats. Will be more careful next time I buy and really read the reviews carefully."
1.0,"Run huge!!! Absolutely huge. I wear xsmall-medium depending on item/fit of clothing and typically like a medium in pj/sweatpants but these fit like an XL or bigger. Super soft and seem so comfy but just way to large. Also a bummer they don’t offer a xsmall or smaller, I don’t even think a small would fit me. The sizing of these is extremely off.  Super disappointed."
1.0,Sizes are not correct I ordered 3 pairs of these in different colors all medium size and only 1 pair fit - the other 2 were so large they fell down to my feet when I put them on -
1.0,Not a true size I wear a medium every sweatpants I own. This is not true to size. They fit my friend who is an xl in sweats. I can fit 3 of me in the mediums. Do not buy!!
1.0,"Poop Mostly crappy! Should've read reviews but it was Cyber Monday & I needed some sweats to exercise, lounge around in & to wear just running into town. I won't be wearing these in public. I'm 145, got a medium thinking they'd be a little tight, they're a little big. There's no way I'll be able to keep them up after I lose 10lbs. And too long, of course, but I'm 5'4 & petite anything is usually too short. UGH! Oh well. At least they are soft & comfy despite being hideous on."
1.0,"Do not buy.. over size and not worth the money The fit. My gosh you need to have true size. I bought these for my granddaughter. I got her large, and the was a 1xor 2 x. You need to rethink this product. I won't buy anything Hanes agian"
1.0,"Run too large! After reading reviews, I ordered a size Small. I normally wear Medium in women's activewear pants (5'4 and 140 lbs) but I would have needed  Extra Small in these pants! They are far too large all around. Waist, thighs, and length. I expected sweatpants to be loose rather than shape-hugging, but these just look baggy and sloppy."
1.0,Hanes sizing I ordered similar pants from a different company. They ordered they were extra large and fit great. Haines yoga pants I ordered a large and they were still too big.
1.0,"Sizing is off The sizing is off. Because it does not have a drawstring (even though it says it does), you can't make the waist fit tighter."
1.0,"WAY too big Usually for clothes I’m either a small or medium depending on the brand. First I tried a medium and they were WAYYYY too big, the fit was like a large-Xlarge. Then I decided to order small and it still ran too big, didn’t even fit my waist and fit more like a medium. The price is great but the sizing is horrible"
1.0,"""Petite"" is NOT petite I ordered the petite small in these pants and they are ridiculously huge. They are way too long in the length and way too big in the waist. I gave them to my mother-in-law who is taller than me by a good 4 inches and they are too long are her as well!"
1.0,"Far too big in the waist. They fall off. These pants run VERY large. I ordered a size smaller than usual and they still fall off me. The waist is HUGE, and I’m in my mid-50s so my waist has basically disappeared. I cannot recommend these unless you don’t card if your pants fall off. There is no rope to tighten the waist."
1.0,"Didn't fit Ordered XL based off sizing chart and they should be labeled 2x or bigger. Pants are not tapered at all and the foot holes are 11 inches wide. Elastic was not stretched in any way when sewed into the band so pants just fall off.  Material was soft but, that's about the only good thing to say about these pants"
1.0,Product is not wearable These are described as having. Drawstring waist. Not only is there is no drawstring there is nothing to make it it fit at all. The waist is only about 1 inch smaller than the hips. Horrible fit
1.0,Too big Waayyy too big
1.0,"not a good buy my wife ordered these pants she ordered them three sizes too small because they were said to run large this is an understatement to say the least, they were about 3 inches too long and about three or four sizes too large!! these should be labled 3x to 5 or 6x, not a good!!!"
1.0,"Don't waste your $ if you're short; they'll make ya pay to return. 🙄 When i ordered ad said PETITE, being 5 foot I cannot buy a single thing is REGULAR length. Now I have to pay to return?? I don't think so. Thanks for assuring I won't waste ANY more money on hanes or hanes products. Maybe make your ad less ambiguous. It was represented AS PETITE AND IS NOT."
1.0,"These Are Not Petite Product looks well made.  I chose Small for the waist size.  I was concerned about the inseam but I wanted to try them, intending on buying two more pair if these fit.The inseam on this pair of sweats is 31 inches.  My inseam is 26 inches.  I will hem them."
1.0,Nice sweats but they come. Too big. I'm writing this review on my husband's profile. The material was very good. I bought two pairs of the. Xl sweats. I liked the colors. It felt nice. When I tried one on it felt at least 2 sizes to big. The length was very long.  Rather then send them back I decided to give them as a christmas gift to family member.
1.0,One pant leg is shorter than the other after I washed them. I bought these to wear after work just to hang out around the house; but when I put them on after I washed them one of the pan legs was shorter than the other.
1.0,"Que están mal hechos , Estaba muy corto, encargué varios en talla M unos me quedaron súper cortos , y otros largos y grandes , todos de la misma medida , de 6 que encargué solo me quedaron 2 y no tenia para elegir que largo lo quería , nomás tenía para escoger M L XL etc"
1.0,"Very over-sized I usually wear a medium but after reading the reviews, ordered a small. I wore them for lounging, but today I wore them to run to town. Then I noticed a huge flaw .. the right leg was at least two inches shorter than the left! Very noticeable when you are wearing shoes! Embarrassing!"
1.0,"What I recieved was too large I ordered womens size small. The item I received was tagged as small, but it was so large it was even too big for my husband.  The return was easy, though. I do appreciate that.  I did like the material."
1.0,"NOT COMFORTABLE. First, This product would be good if size was right....I ordered an xl (the size I am) and it came as if it was a xxxl they are huge on me and don’t even stay on. Second they are very itchy, whatever there made out of is not comfortable. Would not recommend."
1.0,"Poor Quality/Longevity Love the fit and feel, but after only 2 weeks they already have a hole in them from normal use and wear. Extremely poor quality for a Hanes product."
1.0,"Size is way too large! This runs a size too big! It's super comfortable, but even after washing it in the hottest water I possibly could it's still way too large even if I fold over the top band of it. I'm super bummed and I wish I could get a return"
1.0,"These sweats run very very large in size. The sweats are of good quality but run very very large. I normally wear a size small to medium, ordered a small petite and they are huge. I am quite disappointed and needed to return them."
1.0,SIZE OH MY GOODNESS I GOT SOME OF THESE PANT JUST LAST WEEK I GOT THE WRONG SIZE SO I DECIDED TO GET THEM AGAIN TO TRY A SMALLER SIZE AND THE SMALL IS THE SAME AS THE OTHERS TO BIG FALLING OFF  I BROUGHT VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS COMPANY AND CLOTHING
1.0,"Not worth it Needed sweats to work around house or quick errands.  Good material, comfortable but way too long.  5' 2"" and bought medium but they drag.  Wanted no elastic at ankle but now makes it difficult to hem.  Also, wear throughout the day and the pants stretched so never washed them, instead directly in the trash.  Will not purchase more."
1.0,If you want bell-bottoms I “downsized” to medium (5’5” 170 lbs) per reviews but the pants were huge in the legs. Like super bell-bottoms. Not fitted like in the picture. Comfortable at waist though.  Wanted these for walking and exercise outdoors but feel like I’m wearing big pajamas.  Returning them.
1.0,Runs big The pants run big. I sent it to ups for a return and have not received it yet. I do not know who to contact for my money back.
1.0,Oversized Run larger than size indicates.
1.0,"Two legs could fit into one! These were not at all like they were pictured. Purposely bought them because they appeared to have a tapered leg. And did I mention they came up when I searched for a tapered leg? To Amazon's service, I printed a free return label, and the price of the purchase was refunded within two days of mailing them back. Wonderful!"
1.0,These pants were previously worn!!😣 I bought these pants at the end of summer because they were at a good price. Now that it's cold I brought them out to try on only to find that they have been previously worn😖There is wear shown in the seat of the pants and a very small stain.
1.0,"Poor quality, they are Not worth it! The pants fit rather well, unfortunately the fabric is of poor quality and thin, they also, started piling the 1st time they where worn.I bought two pairs thinking they were such a good deal, now, I know why. I will be returning the other pair, even at 8.00, they are over priced."
1.0,"Donating these! A smaller size might fit better but I think they're cut short in the stride. I need pockets, a drawstring especially if they're huge and falling off! I don't care for wide, bell-bottom legs. Want a slimmer leg that the photo implied. I'm donating them to a local thrift store."
1.0,"Huge for ""small"" This was labeled as a small.  The waist line is huge, elastic is barely there.  They fall off!"
1.0,Must be xxx not medium. Absolutely awful. No elastic  in waist. Falls to feet. It's more like xxx not medium. I need a mailing return label !!!!! I'm unable to bring items to willowbrook mall.
1.0,"Big enough for me and another half a person The Hane's ""activeware""  was a huge disappointment. The fabric was very thick and heavy, not summer-friendly. I wear a petite small in almost everything, but these fit more like a large. They are about 8 inches too long and so big that ""mid-rise"" was way above my waist and wide enough for 1 1/2 of me. I was overly optimistic before I tried them on  that I threw away  the package, so I will pass them on to a bigger person and send back the 2nd pair."
1.0,"Site says petite sizes available, but none offered d that we could see. My wife searched for petite sweatpants. Site recommended large size. Would have ordered large petite, but that size was not offered in size choices. When they arrived, Pat's where about a foot too long. Never bothered to check waist. Please don't offer a petite item you do not have them available! Just wasting everyone's time."
1.0,"All different The first pair I got a large and they were way too big so I got 3 more in medium. All different colors and every single pair fits different. One is too big, one is to small in the waist, one is too short and one is too long."
1.0,"These are Huge, the Size Chart is Wrong The pants are a nice material and would be fine if they were sized right.  I bought a small based on a 35"" hip, as shown on the size chart.They are HUGE!  Not just loose, but the waistband is so large they just totally fall off.  It's not worth the hassle to return at this price, so I'll just donate them.  But I really dislike losing money because the description is totally wrong.  I can't even imagine a X-Small fitting."
1.0,"CHEAP! I suspect these are made in a sweat shop somewhere and they sewed in Hanes labels falsely, because Hanes is a quality brand. These are not quality. They have no shape. I also think they know that it's a lot of bother to return things through Amazon for most of us."
1.0,"Size The mediums and smalls are so large for a 5'5"" 130 lb female.Very loose and baggy, scratchy feeling on my skin, the tag is also annoying plastic type feeling which I cannot remove so if you cut it off it will still scratch.I ordered 5 pairs and donated them."
1.0,Way to big I am 126 lbs and 4 months pregnant. Even over my belly they are still to big. I almost thought I ordered the wrong size. I only bought these because I needed cheap lounge pants. I’m going to keep them as I assume I’ll get bigger. But way to big.
1.0,"the small sweat pant is over-sized. I have enjoyed my Hanes sweat pants purchased here 4 yrs ago.  These were to freshen up my old Hanes sweat pants.  However, the small is too large and boxy for a 5'2'' 108 pound woman.  Hanes needed to give attention to detail on the cut.  The navy heather color and fabric was nice."
1.0,Fit is odd More room in the front than in the rear. Waistband comes up higher in the front than the back. If you walk more than 10 steps the pants start falling down
1.0,Run large Too large ... oversized
1.0,they are very thin They look like they were made ok but they are too big around the waist. they are so thin I'm not sure I would be warm wearing them outside to shovel snow.
1.0,Does not look like the picture!! Very disappointed They were for my 14 yr old granddaughter for Christmas. I was very disappointed because they didn't look anything like the picture. Definitely not a medium and the legs were huge!
1.0,"Poor quality & a waste of money!😠 These pants are poor quality! Within an hour of wearing them, lint began 2 accumulate between the crouch area of the pants. After 1 wash, the product has shorten in length above the ankles! I will never buy these pants again! The company should refund my money for all three pairs of pants!!!"
1.0,"There isn't any elastic or string to hold the pants up. There isn't any elastic or string to hold the pants up. I have hips and a waist, but the pant waist is bigger than the hips and they work their way down. It's embarrassing"
1.0,"Inconsistent sizing/quality I've tried purchasing several colors and found that none fit the same.  A few pair actually have one leg longer than the other. The sizing difference between the L and XL varied between 3-5 inches in the waist.  Disappointing, especially since they carry the HANES brand name.  Ultimately, I had to purchase 8 pair to get 3 that were wearable."
1.0,Runs very large I’m 5’3 and I usually wear a large but these pants fit weird. They’re way too big in the waist and too short in the legs.
1.0,humongus I have worn Hanes tops and bottoms for years and this pair of pants was ridiculously huge. They were an xxxxxlg if anything. And the worst part was that I had to pay $6 to return an $11 pair of pants. Never Again!
1.0,"Friggin' HUGE! To say these run large is an understatement. I'm a size 8, yet wear a large in most pants with elastic (sweats, yoga pants, leggings, etc.). So I ordered a Medium. The medium is more like an extra large!! Very bummed... especially because I bought TWO pairs!"
1.0,Not a good fit Too long (petite size)  Waist has no elastic and is large so they fall down. They wash terribly. Bought 3 more pairs but returning them.
1.0,My Fault? I should have ordered a size small but it said order a large. Too huge. I guess it’s my fault for ordering a large cause it’s huge.  I’m gonna give them to my son. I’m gonna try a small now cause they are on a special price.
1.0,"These sweatpants run really large. Both Large and XL were too big for me. Both large and extra large were way too big. I weigh between 136 and 142, depending. A medium might have been a better choice. I had to use the L, when all other sweat pants were in the wash. I gifted the XL to a heavier person."
1.0,"Don't order! These are hugh and unfitted These pants do not fit. They are too big, even the small size. No shape to them at all, poorly made, no quality control at all. I tried 3 pair, different color and size, none fit. Returned 2 and threw away the 3rd pair, they are that bad."
1.0,"Stay away, horrible So angry,  I was sent a men's medium and not a woman's.  I was injured and bought these for ease of wearing. Unfortunately I threw them in the wash before I realized the sellers error. Do not buy."
1.0,Enormous SO LARGE that I returned them immediately.  The cut also appeared weird — hip & waist essentially same size.  I switched to a different brand for re-order.  I guess Hanes sweatpants aren’t what they used to be.
1.0,"Overly big. Does not fit to sizing chart. Absolutely terrible. I’m an x-small. I ordered this in the smallest size and it was so so big on me. I was highly disappointed but amazon gave me a full refund without having to return it, even tho I have no use for these. If I could give 0 stars I would. But I thank amazon for giving me refund."
1.0,"Sizing is not accurate. First of all, the sizing chart was not accurate.  Said I should order medium. Way too small for my full figure. Went up 2 sizes, length too long, waist and hips too tight. The material is nice. I also can't wear thick waistbands, they roll when I sit."
1.0,Awful! Save your money. These run HUGE  and very unflattering. It’s ok to clean the house in.
1.0,"Pants way to small. Have 3 pairs, not even close to correct size Have 3 pairs. Of LG Hanes sweat pants, this pair is not even close to correct size. Order says ""petite "" I ordered LG"
1.0,"Insanely oversized When I pulled these pants out of the bag, I cracked up laughing. These are like ridiculously large clown pants. Seriously, order 2 sizes down."
1.0,"Nice sweatpants Nice pants, but I could fit both of my legs on one side.  I ordered a large and they could fit a 250 Lb man.  I returned them."
1.0,"No drawstring at waist so I returned them! Very disappointed! Very disappointed! No drawstring at waist, so I returned them! I love Hanes products, but this was not a good experience!"
1.0,"Disappointed I bought a pair of these at WalMart a couple years ago and really liked them so when I seen them online I thought I would get another pair. Unfortunately, when I received them and tried them on they were way to big. I don't think I will buy any more pants online again."
1.0,"Cheap quality I am 5’7”, 125lbs.  I got a small.  The waist was gaping around my abdomen, I had to fold it over so that the pants wouldn’t fall down.  At the same time, the legs were very skinny, and too tight on my thighs. They were just... misshapen.  Also the material was thin and cheap.  Do not waste your money."
1.0,It smells! Bad! And washing it didn't remove the odor.  Also way to large for the size it states. It smells. Washing it did not remove the smell. Also way to big for the size.
1.0,"A BIG mistake! I had to return them because they were so big that I would have to gain 50 pounds so that they would not fall off me.  Otherwise, good quality, bargain price because of mistake in size."
1.0,"The sizing is WAY to big! I ordered a small, I measured the waist and it measured 35"". In what universe is a small 35""? 35"" would be a large at least! The inside tag says small and the label on the bag says small. These should be removed from Amazon."
1.0,Waistband loose After first the wearing the waistband loosened and was too big afterwards.
1.0,"No Drawstring Bought these specifically because they were supposed to have a drawstring. I bought these for upcoming knee surgery in a large so they would be roomy. Unfortunately, without the drawstring, they are way too large. Will have to return."
1.0,Will shrink about 4 or 5 inches in length I got these and thought it good they are long that’s what I need  Washed them and now the length is way above my ankles.  Very very short.  I ordered 4 pair. Can’t believe they would shrink that much.  So disappointed.
1.0,I’m disappointed. I looked into the reviews bc everyone said that it fits well..I ordered a small &’ they r veryyy loose sadly.
1.0,These were huge and I could not wear them The size was way too big. They would not stay up on their own and there was no drawstring to tie.
1.0,these fit bigger than expected! the length is perfect and they are soft. but they are so big in the waist i cant comfortably wear them in public
1.0,"Not the right measurements at all Way too short in length, too tight in hips/waist area for the size they’re supposed to be"
1.0,"Runs large Was not happy with the fit. I should of ordered a size smaller. They said petite. Not the case, they were really long. So if your super tall go for it.The price is good for a pair of sweat pants for around the house."
1.0,Large is HUGE I ordered two of these pants in large.  I generally like a looser fit.  These were HUGE!  I am giving them away.
1.0,they run very large I did not like this product at all .. The sizing was way off and the fabric was very thin
1.0,"Not accurate sizing UPDATE...I received these on September 21st and returned them right away. I have yet to receive a refund.They were NOT a woman's large. They could have easily fit my 6'3 son. Not only were they extremely long, but I could fit both legs in one."
1.0,It's too baggy I got it for my 12-yr-old daughter and she doesn't like to wear it because it's baggy at the crotch.  There's no way to cinch it up because it doesn't have a string inserted in it.  Will try to put one in myself.  Wouldn't buy it again.
1.0,These are HUGE I got a Women's size L (gray) as I am a size 10/12. These are HUGE. I think they are MEN's size not Women's. After washing and drying hot they are still way too big. I think their inventory is stocked wrong.
1.0,Poor quality… would not recommend Disliked
1.0,Disgust OMG THIS WAS SENT TO ME COVERED AND I MEAN COVERED WITH ANIMAL HAIR.  SO SOMEONE WORE THEM RETURNED THEM AND WAS RESENT OUT HAIR STAINS AND ALL WTH.  GREAT FOR SOMEONE WITH ALLERGIES YO ANIMAL HAIR!!! SO DISGUSTED RIGHT NOW.
1.0,Trash It’s at least 3 size bigger then it showed. No way to ware.
1.0,"Huge! Ordered a small S(4-6). Purchased these pants/sweats for my mom after her stay in the hospital. I ordered a small (4-6). To my surprise, these pants would fit a very large person! They are very short in length and probable a size 14-16! Too late to return unfortunately!"
1.0,"Poor quality! Sweat pants were of poor quality, thin fabric, no drawstring to tighten the waist but length was appropriate.  Will try another option."
1.0,Nice material but way too big I bought these and had no idea how big they were. I had to donate them.
1.0,"Received men’s sweatpants Listing was for women’s petite pants.  I received a pair of men’s sweatpants as the size L was gigantic, and about 8” too long lol."
1.0,Way too big for a medium This was supposed to be a women’s medium. It fit like an extra large. Was way too baggy and loose in the waist. Definitely runs too big. Or they shipped a men’s and not a women’s. Tag says medium. The fit is definitely an extra large.
1.0,Too too large This product runs REALLY LARGE… I normally wear a medium and would have needed an extra small in this pant
1.0,"Not quite The fit was a small on the legs and large in the hips/waist. Awkward and uncomfortable. Not drawstring to keep the waist up. The material was rough, scratchy, and uncomfortable. Very disappointed!"
1.0,"Ugly and Ill made This pair of pants is so ill made and when I received it, they were as big as a circus tent. You get what you pay for. By far the ugliest and cheapest item out there. I threw them away. Don't waste your money."
1.0,Way to big This not only runs too large but too long. Not even close to a petite large. I’m 5’2” and 155lbs and it’s not even close to fitting me.
1.0,"Too Large it's soft and light weight. Bought the same pants in a different color which fit nicely. When I ordered different color, it came in too big. I am guessing these are returned items for wrong sizes that are being sold on Amazon. Not good."
1.0,Don’t order if looking for sweats! These pants are more like leggings but loose at the top. The fabric is thin. They are cheaply made and I’m returning them.
1.0,Poor sizing These are fine except for the large waist. I can't  wear them til I figure out you to put a drawstring in the waistband.  Since waistband are stretchy you would think they would make them a bit small rather than too big.
1.0,"Wayyy to big! These pants were wayyyy to large. I’m 5’7 135ibs and usually wear a medium and according to a lot of the reviews, that was the correct size to order. This medium has to have the wrong tag on it because they look like and L/XL"
1.0,they run big long and loose they need to have a size to fit slim women
1.0,Do not order these and waste your money ! Absolutely disappointing. I ordered a small size and it looks like they’ve made this fit for a large size and it feels like I am wearing grandma’s pants. The fitting is horrible. Will not order again.
1.0,"Seam failure Worn 3 times washed twice. The seam in the crotch came undone. There isn't any sign of strain or pull, just like the seam wasn't given enough allowance when sewn. Very disappointed. Love the leg style, love the fabric. Won't buy again."
1.0,Ok if you have legs like an elephant these are huge These are huge. I am super disappointed I bought these for after surgery and now not sure what to do with them
1.0,Huge! I bought a woman’s small petite and my entire body fit in one leg. I felt like maybe these were men’s pants but the packaging said woman’s small petite. I was disappointed because the material felt great for lounging around the house.
1.0,Size is way off I purchased  3 colors same size and each one had a 2 to 3 inch size difference  in length and waist  1 pr was shorter and waist was ok the other 2 were longer with 2 and 3 inch bigger waist
1.0,Do Not Buy Black fuzz all over my white carpet with every step I take.  Do Not Buy!!
1.0,"Way to big I bought a small because I am always that size. It came in what looks like a size large, they are so huge for what should have been a small/petite."
1.0,Strange shape Ordered by size listing and they are too big and too longShaped strangely with waist larger than hipsI cannot wear theseI have bought and worn Hanes for year’s but have never seen any item like this
1.0,Pants were much bigger than I expected Pants were much bigger than size indicated.  I returned them.
1.0,Disappointing. These pants are very large even though I sized down.  They also pill a lot once they are washed.  The deal i got made sense once I received the pants.  I wouldn’t recommend this product.
1.0,"Runs extremely large Not only were these too long and sized large, the legs are so wide I trip on them!!"
1.0,"Extremely Large For being a women's large these sweatpants are ""HUGE"".  My son who is 6'3"" tall and 280lbs. held them up and I'm pretty sure he could have stepped into them.  I'm  wondering if they were miss-marked... ??  Either way Amazon was great about the refund."
1.0,A little big Pants were too big in the waist and too short in the legs.
1.0,No tags gross Yes they run big. But no tags?  EWWW  I probably got a used pair that were returned. Trashed.Not only were they too big there was nothing at the waist to define it. No gather. Literally falling off me.
1.0,"unable to return as I don't have a QR code. What???? I', 83 yrs old. not really savvy in that arena well if it costs $11.99 a pair, you get what you pay for -  ugh"
1.0,"They do not look as pictured I understand that I have a different body type than the model pictured, but these pants are extremely unflattering. They are super wide and chunky looking. They were inexpensive so I will keep them to use as paint pants, or something."
1.0,Make sure they are a pair of sweats.................... This was not a pair of black sweats it had a Hanes live  love  comfort  L/G 39a lite weight jacket  in the bag that was marked black sweatsThis is not right please I need some help here
1.0,"WAY TOO BIG I ordered the size small and they are so big that they fit my 6'0, 170 pound husband.  Because they only cost $5.99 I am not going to return them and my husband will use them as pajama bottoms."
1.0,"Large is super large I bought a size large, which sometimes I have to worry about being too small.  Not these.  I could fit 4 legs into one pant leg, and I my leg also needs to be about 8 inches longer."
1.0,"Unisex Basically they are selling mens pants to women. Huge is the waist, tight in the hips."
1.0,"medium?  haha These pants are medium, yet they are larger than the large I buy. Too big, too long too big in the waist, the width of the legs and the length.  horrible.  I buy the large for myself, these were a gift and I couldn't believe how big they were."
1.0,"WAY TO BIG! I couldn't wait to get these (3) pants. I opened 1 and WOW I could have got to of me. I ordered smaller than your chart. Now I don't have a smart phone, nor.printer, no car to get these back to you. What do you suggest?"
1.0,"Very disappointed. I ordered for small and got a small (at least that's what the tag says) but when I tried it on.... it was 2_3 inches too long and a size to  sizes too big that it practically slid down. I'd say even an Xsmall would still be too large for me. I tried laundering it with hopes that it'll shrink a little but no luck.For reference.... I am 5'2"" and normally wear size 4.Very disappointed."
1.0,Very upset expected more out of your product will let everyone know Does not fit at all waist too big legs too short will be used as a dust rag Yes you heard me right a dust rag do not waste your money very upset
1.0,Xl pants I ordered an xl. It is really like a 3xl it is super big. But they did tell me to keep the item and gave me my money back. So now I will jus give them to someone else.

1.0,Pilling after one wear! Love the color but after wearing one time the have tons of fuzz balls! After washing them twice i had to throw them away because they looked so gross! Do not recommend unless you like only wearing your clothing one time!
1.0,No to big booty women Waist is extremely to wide- if ur butt is big and around..  DONT BUY. The seam isn’t long enough for coverage. They only use $6 fabric- I promise you it won’t cover.Not worth the $$ to return
1.0,Very disappointed I ordered XL... As I am bigger than my past... But just a mere XL looks like they would be like a 4x... Very disproportionate and did not fir the chart. Low quality and fit is WAY OFF! 👎
1.0,I'd never order them again The leg width was huge! Enough room for two people in one leg! Way too long ..I ordered the same size as the hanes sweatpants I have already.The only thing true to size was the waist!
1.0,Poor Fit I am a size 10 and bought a large and it was way to big.  The grey was almost black. Also the bottom of the pants were like very wide. Not pleased and sending it right back!
1.0,Item Picture was misleading This item was absolutely gross!!  Not at all what I expected!!
1.0,way to short they should have labeled them petite not regular they were so short
1.0,"This is awful material.  Cheap as hell. I hated it, doesn't look at all like the picture. Very poor quality materialIN FACT, EVERYTHING I BUY FROM AMAZON - IN REGARDS TO CLOTHING - IS OF POOR QUALITY MATERIAL AND SEWING WISE"
1.0,NO ABILITY TO ADJUST THE WAISTLINE These sweatpants don't have a drawstring to tighten the waist.  The legs are long and wide.  I tried to return them but must've taken too long to do so because it's not an option on here anymore to do so.
1.0,"Petite! Ordered size XL but recieved Petite XL. Would exchange, but no description to verify sizing. No size option for Petite so sizing unclear."
1.0,"Too large and shapeless There is nothing remotely good about these sweatpants. As others have said, they are shapeless and way too large--the legs are huge. I got a medium and while way too big, the pants are actually too short, Very disappointed--woud not recommend."
1.0,Avoid. Waist band stretched out after 2 washings. I washed twice and wore them twice. Wast band was all stretched out. I wonder if these are genuine Hanes.
1.0,Sent back. Did not fit good on hip to waist Just did not fit good
1.0,"not even close to correct size These don't even come close to the correct size, and there is something off about the fit at the waist, too - the back doesn't even come up to the waist. These are going back and I won't order from this company again."
1.0,"Why too large for a small. Returned these pants.  Although thick and warm, just felt they were missized."
1.0,"Quality is poor The price and fit are fine,  but there was a hole in one pantleg and they're way too wide at the ankles.  Fortunately,  I have a sturdy sewing machine and a lot of time on my hands."
1.0,"Save your money Paid 7.50 and still feel ripped off.Super comfy at first, but run big. To make things worse pants stretch on their own throughout the day barely making them wearable at waist.  Wouldn’t even purchase as PJs"
1.0,"No elastic or drawstring, they fall off They have no elastic. They literally fell off of me. I had to put a safety pin in them the 1st time I wore them. There is no draw string or any way to keep them tight around the waist."
1.0,"Way to long They fit weird, length was 6 inches to long.  They slide down.  I’ll keep them but won’t buy again."
1.0,"THEY CAME RIPPED!! THE ITEM LOOKED WORN & THEY WERE RIPPED! VERY DISAPPOINTED,I AM TERMINALLY ILL AND CANT GET OUT TO SHOP, I NEED PANTS LIKE THAT, FOR GOING TO HOSPITAL, DOC. ETC, VERY DISAPPOINTED TO BE AWAITING THEM TO FIND I COULD NOT WEAR THEM!! VERY SAD!!!"
1.0,"Me quedó muy grande A pesar de haber llegado la talla que compre el pantalón es sumamente grande me quedo volando de todos los lados a pesar de que la tela estaba maravillosa, las tallas tienen que adaptarlas mejor"
1.0,The fit is off They are a heavier than I like and the cut feels off. I don’t like them.
1.0,Not good They were much larger than expected and also had a very strong chemical smell to them so bad that even if they did fit I would have sent them back due to the smell.
1.0,"Weird fit. Great price but weird fit. I bought small. I’m 5’ and weigh 120. They were 4-5 inches too long. I would’ve just hemmed them, but they were baggy and the waist was tight!  Very thin fabric. Returned."
1.0,Legs too long These pants are so poorly made that the legs are 3x longer than they're supposed to be. I can hold them up to my neck and the hemline is at the floor. Cheap material. Don't waste your money.
1.0,"Don’t buy!! Waste of money!! The elastic waistband is non existent, there is no stretch whatsoever, it’s like they are irregular & a poor waistband so they thought they’d unload these on clearance-nod a deal if they are defective, I’m pretty annoyed!!"
1.0,"It sheds on the inside and beads up in between legs. They are too  short, they shed on the inside and beads up in between the legs."
1.0,Terrible work The material was not what I expected they were badly cut I will never purchase anything from that company again
1.0,"You get what you Pay for I've had these for a week and they already have a hole in the rear seam. In addition to that, they pill like crazy around the thigh area AND inside the pants so it's always leaving little fluffy things everywhere."
1.0,"The waist has NO elastic or ties These sweatpants have NO elastic at the waist, nor any ties to keep them up.  I returned them."
1.0,Order size down. I liked the fabric and wish they weren't so large. Order one size down from usual size
1.0,These run very large I usually wear a size small but these were literally falling off and no tie at the waist to hold them up.
1.0,Hate them No draw string. Always falling down and shrunk way too short after washing
1.0,"Got a hole in them after wearing for one day I wore these just ONE time, then the next day I noticed there was a hole in the crotch area. I had ordered two other colors too. I sure hope they are better quality."
1.0,"Awful Fit I bought these exact pants retail two years ago and need to replace them. These are not the same pant. I ordered a small and found they fit everywhere but the waist. The waist on these is almost 2"" larger than the small pair I own. Also, the front is higher than the back causing weird bagginess in the front. Returned them and went back to retail."
1.0,Pants had a hole in them. Expect new products to in good condition.These fleece pants had a hole in the leg.
1.0,Huge!! I cannot wear these- ostensibly a size S but the pants couldn't possibly be labelled correctly. They are HUGE. Never again.
1.0,awful Even my husband laughed when he saw me in the pants.
1.0,"Best for a petite person As a 5'10"" woman these sweatpants were too shortwaisted and too short in the leg. I had ordered the Large due to the reviews. I do not believe the XL would be much better."
1.0,Size large was way too big I wear a size 12 in a jean so I bought a large - I could have fit 2 of me in them. I then bought a medium and they fit perfectly
1.0,"Poorest quality, got a hole in outer thigh seam after one wash Extremely disappointed, these have changed in quality since I bought my last couple pairs from Walmart a few years back. A quarter sized hole appeared in the outer thigh seam after just one wash."
1.0,"Huge These are HUGE. A women's size small was actually 35"" waist when measured. Way too big and not at all what the sizing chart suggests. I had to return them.At least the return was easy."
1.0,"Terrible for me. I ordered size small, petite.  Way too large and way too long.  Can’t wear them.  Had to give them to someone else.  I will never again order clothing from Amazon."
1.0,"Bad 2nd order I bought a pair of these in October that I loved, fit well and washed well. Ordered 3 more  in February  because i liked them so much. Unfortunately for me new order is not the same. They fit but were a bit smaller, and now when washed they shrunk so much and are about 4 inches above my ankles. Just horrible ,cold ankles,disappointed"
1.0,"Runs big If these are the size large I ordered, I returned them on Jan 18 & still have not received my refund. If these were the size medium I ordered, the size medium fit perfect."
1.0,Incorrectly sized Nice color and fabric. Ordered size up but still too tight in the crotch. Had to return. Not a good product if you have a big stomach. Long length.
1.0,😒 This is the biggest Medium size I ever seen. It is more like XXL
1.0,Too Much Lint Don't buy these. I bought three pairs for physical therapy and they covered my entire washing with lint. Just covered. One pair of then left about two full cups of lint all over my clothes and inside the washer. I spent hours cleaning off my clothes with a lint brush.
1.0,These pants are a misses medium or large at best. Back seam 18” and front seam 13” Nothing to like. Pants are not 2xl! At best a misses medium or large. Knit is too thin.

1.0,"It's not for petite women for at all rather foe the tallest women. This supposed to be a petite. However, the product arrived and it fit my husband who is 6""7 perfectly and I am 5""2; now you just imagine, how long that could be for me."
1.0,Not right material for me. These sweats were inexpensive and came on time. I did not like the material and they did not fit well. They were too large.

1.0,huge sweats I ordered the medium regular and I couldn't believe how big they were. The waist was huge and they were falling off. The pant leg was way too big. I am returning these pants and will not buy any other Hanes pants.
1.0,"I would go another way I used to feel confident in buying from Hanes , not anymore , these pants are poorly made , they fell apart after no wear and only one wash , don't waste your money"
1.0,Wide legs These are shown to be straight legs but actually are very very wide legs.. other than that the fit is perfect.. I did return them because of the extra wide legs..

1.0,It has no pockets I’m so sad they don’t have pockets. I wouldn’t have bought them had I known.
1.0,"Legs very wide. I didn’t even try these on; I’m returning them. The bottom of the legs is wider than anything I’ve seen since the 70’s. I like a straight leg, but they were ridiculously wide."
1.0,Not great Look and feel like “old lady pants”.  Loose waste with wide band come up high.  Not appealing on.  Get what you pay for in this case.

1.0,One Star The elastic in the waistband of these pants is almost not worth having.
1.0,very bad quality They keep slipping. Got spoiled after first wash.
1.0,Pants run larger than expected. Pants are larger than expected. Legs on pants are very wide. Petite length is longer than expected.
1.0,Really?? Thesse pants are a joke. I ordered a small and I knew they would be larger than normal but I wanted some to go over my yoga tights when I am outside walking in the cold. I don't know who thinks these are anywhere near small. I could wrap the waist around my waist nearly twice. These are awful. If you were  a large size maybe order a small but I bet they would still be too big.
1.0,One Star The hoodies sucked and so did the pants worse thing ever bought

1.0,One Star Humongous
1.0,One Star 😡
1.0,One Star They were huge.
1.0,One Star Ripped after the first wear
1.0,"Sweatpants were way too large. The sweatpants were both supposed to be larges, but they were not. I would guesstimate that one was actually an XL heather blue ones and the gray was most likely XXL. I could swim in the sweatpants. But I am afraid to exchange them due to the fact the ones I received are both size different even though they are both marked as size large."
1.0,too heavy too heavy
1.0,"Elastic waist is too loose and stretches out in a short time, I like the idea of these sweat pants, however after purchasing several in different colors, I find that the waist band elastic is too loose to start with and becomes totally unwearable after a short time.  I was hoping that Hanes had corrected this problem, but no they didn't."
1.0,"So large I can share! I feel somewhat bad for only 1 star all around, but...These are positively ENORMOUS!  They're not just a little large - they are ridiculous!  I ordered a MEDIUM. I double-checked the inside label to be certain there wasn't a mistake in the size they sent. Nope. The tag clearly shows M; medium. They are large enough to pass for an XL!  I put them on, they fall straight to the floor!  The waistband doesn't even make contact with my body!  The waistband measures 36”!"
1.0,"These pants were a huge disappointment. The product description said these pants have a drawstring closure, but there is nothing there, not even holes to insert a drawstring. They fall off of me so are useless. I am a senior citizen with no way to get them to a free shipping locale and your new cost to return is 3/4 the price of the item. I thought I could trust Hanes, and Amazon, but evidently not. I just threw money away needlessly, and am very disappointed."
1.0,"Large size is WAY too large, like XXL My waist is 33"", hips 38"". Amazon suggested I buy a large, but this was falling off me. The WAIST of the pants I received is 38""!! Can I not trust Hanes's sizing?!! Sheesh. The tag in the pants does say LG/G/G, but maybe it was tagged wrong."
1.0,"Should be 1x, not 2x Too big. Package marked incorrectly"
1.0,Horribly wrong sizing Pants are comfortable but are so big they are ridiculous. Even the legs looks about 3 times too much material around the legs. UPDATE. Put them thru washer and dryer. They did shrink a little. So that helped.
1.0,"See through, thinnest material Why can’t they spend a few dollars more and make it not see-through? Why are clothes on Amazon such low quality?"
1.0,Needs a drawstring The waist is huge
1.0,Legs Disliked the bell bottoms!  They were huge!  Not what I expected in the  legs.
1.0,Very large fit Had to return the large looks like 2x. But they feel like they are very comfy. Just ran much larger than I expected.
1.0,HATE that they dropped the drawsting The waistband they use now is cheap and stretches easily.MUCH prefer the drawstring
1.0,The waist is enormous with no draw string. Plus there’s no pockets and the material is thin.
1.0,"I'll never use ""try before you buy"" again. My wife normally gets a Large.  Since the comment ""Runs large-order smaller size"" was there, we ordered a Medium.  That was too large!  When I tried to reorder the smaller size, they were out of most of the colors in the small - including one of the pants.the Amazon ""try before you buy"" is totally for the birds.  They shipped the four pieces in one envelope.  As I had previous problems opening the envelope, I had learned to cut the bottom of the envelope.  Not till  I rescued the envelope di I see the instructions on how to open it.  Any by that time all of the ""dust envelopes"" and the original wrap were totally mixed up with nothing to see to select the correct envelopes.  Order summary did not provide any matching numbers on the envelopes."
1.0,Very large! I bought these for my elderly mom and ordered the small/petite. What I received was a pair that were huge! Way too long with very wide legs.
1.0,"Not good if you have a butt. I haven’t purchased sweatpants in a while, but I had previously liked Hanes.  I knew I was about to have a problem when I couldn’t tell the front from the back without checking for the tag.  From waist to crotch is the same in the front and back, so if they fit flat in the front, where is your butt supposed to go if it isn’t flat?"
1.0,"Order a size up! After seeing consumer reports about the fit, I ordered one size down.  They fit just fine when I tried them on. After one wash, they were too tight in the waist.  I guess you get what you pay for!  For you ladies with a bit of a stomach and larger hips, I would not waste my money!"
1.0,"Hip and waste measurement were the same, horrible fit The fit on these is horrible. The waist and hip measurements are the same so they tend to ride down. I even ordered a size smaller than recommended based on other reviews saying the fit runs large. There is no additional elastic in the waist and not even a drawstring."
1.0,"Elephant sized waist I went by the positive reviews and the price and ordered these. They’re good quality, look like they’d last, but this means nothing if you can’t wear them. I ordered the smallest size possible and couldn’t keep them on when they arrived. The waist is HUGE. I’m taking about 4-6 inches longer than my other sweatpants. You can’t sew them or pin them without creating a bulge on the side. Gave them to my husband to wear around the house, the fit is off but at least the pants stay on him. Not a good buy at all."
1.0,the fit Again they are way too big for the size
1.0,The sizes run very big  my wt 130 5ft 2in Need to send all back on that order
1.0,Way Way too large! I am sure glad we did the try before you buy option.  Mom is a size 16- 18 and the  L and XL were massive on her.
1.0,"Way too large Ordered a petite small, and although that's what the sticker on the plastic bag said, the actual pants were way too long and way to big overall. The tag sewn into the pants said only ""small."" But I suspect it was mislabled. It seemed like it was actually a regular length large. Oh well, you get what you pay for.... which explains why it was only $7.99 on Amazon Prime Now. Not worth returning."
1.0,"Feels like poly, wouldn’t hate if the waist wasn’t 4-5” too big. Waist was huge. When I tried to return they gave me a five dollar credit and told me to keep them.  I am donating them to a local shelter."
1.0,Look at butt seam closely before leaving house. You may have hole in butt at seam. 1st time wearing and I am out and just realized theres a hole in the butt. Been out and about all day and wondered why people were staring at me.
1.0,"These pill HORRIBLY!!! after only one wear! These are made of the cheapest fabric possible, which pills after only one wear and looks terrible! I do not recommend these at all!"
1.0,Bad quality and shrunk after one wash with lint fuzz The pants were fine when they arrived but now they have shrunk after only one wash and now it has lint fuzz all over it and color faded.
1.0,EcoSmart could be much more eco-smart. From the Hanes website: Made with up to 5% polyester created from recycled plastic bottles.So the polyester (half of the fabric in the pants) is only 90%+ virgin plastic. :-(
1.0,RUN too big for size ordered Need free exchange in smaller size. PRODUCT RUNS BIG !lNeed replaced with sixe smaller @ same price and free shipping. Equal exchange. Pants defective.
1.0,Had hole after one use Already had a hole in them from one use of just relaxing around the house
1.0,Poor quality Very poor quality fabric. It pills. Had to wash it separately.
1.0,Horrible High water sweats that shrink easily when washed. Wouldn’t purchase
1.0,Nothing petite about them. Need petite size
1.0,Too small The fit was at least 3 sizes too small.
1.0,"These are women models but mens sizes These are men's sizes, not for women!!"
1.0,Large. Too large: waist and length.
1.0,"Huge! Ordered in Small, which fits me in shorts by the same maker, but these fit like Medium or even Large. Also too long."
1.0,"Too Too Large Have pair that fits well and marked Hanes Large. I ordered two pair, but are huge. Ordered two medium and still too large. Will order small as trial."
1.0,Unwearable DO NOT BUY! I ordered two sizes down and yet it was still large on me around my waist. I’m so disappointed in these and they aren’t worth the money.
1.0,Horrible Small size is xtra large.
1.0,sizing is way off these pants were not what i expected. the fit was loose (falling off loose) ant rise was short and the legs were wide. Will be returning to Amazon
1.0,These pants are HUGE! The small size fit like a large.
1.0,RUNS HUGE Huge! These run massively too large. The sizing chart is WAY OFF. I'm not happy because I needed these for a vacation and now too late to order again. I'm normally an XL but ordered an xxl so they'd be roomy enough to layer. They fit more like a 3X or 4X.
1.0,Wide fit like bell bottoms I bought the xxl. These are way too long and are help bottoms. Say to wide at the bottom. So disappointed. I'm not sending them back due to the cheap price and will ONLY wear them around the house. I don't recommend.
1.0,"wrong size - not women's bought a large & it's clearly a large for men. isn't even an xl woman or xxl.  so huge, we laughed when it came out of the bag.  what a waste of time"
1.0,The legs were for plus size people I need you to send me another products because the legs were entirely too wide
1.0,Sized incorrectly Way too big
1.0,5 inches bigger around the waste. Do Not buy these Wow these pants are huge.  5 inches bigger around the waste.  Do Not buy these. Something very wrong with this product!  Also bought the ladies hooded sweatshirt and it was fine.
1.0,Way too big These were way too big.  Is there some way I can return them?
1.0,One Star Baggy
1.0,"sized for a sumu wrestler. I usually take extra small, but not available , bought small. petite. hoping . they arrived today I am still laughing. they could fit a man about 5 foot 10 inches weighing about 180. I weigh 93. not worth the trouble of returning.  why I wonder could they have not been properly sized . I do not get it."
1.0,to long way to long for a small
1.0,"Runs very big sent this back.  I usually get large in pants, but this fit like a plus size"
1.0,One Star Ordered a medium and they were so big. Can use them. Tried to shrink them. Still to big.
1.0,"I'm 5'2"" and 123lbs, usually a size 8 or ... I'm 5'2"" and 123lbs, usually a size 8 or medium. I ordered small because of reviews that said they run big. They were huge in the waist. I can't wear them. Sending them back"
1.0,"This sweet pants are really nice Maybe I should have considered the word ""womans"" because I always wear medium, weigh 117 lbs. This was probably my error. This sweet pants are really nice, just Hugh."
1.0,"Extremely oversized It is extremely oversized! I ordered m and xl for me and my mom, and now my mom wears my m, and I have nothing to wear!"
1.0,"They are weird fitting. Weird fitting. I bought a medium.. Tighter on thighs (which never is my case) but very weird across hip area, tight directly under belly button tight.. way to long. Youbwould think maybe just too small a size but then the legs flared a but and were insanely long.. completely Awful. Returned."
1.0,"I don't understand why these size are so hugeeeee I normally wear size L - XL pants. I saw it from the review saying these are running way bigger than usual. So I ordered small for myself. I was little worried if this is going to be too small for me. Until I received it today, oh boy, It is Scarily HUGE. I feel like I am a little kid wearing grownup's pant."
1.0,PILLING!!! After one day wearing with the sweatshirt there was pilling all over! I’m in a wheelchair and the lap was nothing but little pills. Very disappointed.
1.0,Pilling and holes on first wear I got these pants in blue and black. Like others have mentioned these pants run very large. I did not mind them being loose. They were soft and very comfortable to wear. But only after wearing them for the first time for about 3-4 hours i noticed the fuzz balls on the inner thigh area and holes in the pant 😐. Do not buy these pants and waste your money.
1.0,Runs way too  LARGE!! FYI  Ordered 8-10 which turns out to be 12-14 or maybe larger.  Will keep this to give to someone who wears larger size. And reorder smaller.
1.0,Diappointed I was looking for a loose fitting sweat pants to exercise in. This is loose with no belt ties to hold pant up. No shape.
1.0,"For a Hanes product, no quality! The pants is weird thick double fabric, stiff, and the waist is not elastic! This is nothing as they described!"
1.0,These are huge! The measurements on Amazon are wrong. A small (2-4) is more like a size (8-10).
1.0,Runs LARGE. Good fabric and construction for the money.  My rating is solely based on the fact that they run ENORMOUSLY large.  I returned them.
1.0,"Very large Had to return,  ordered a small was about the size of a large"
1.0,WHOA I bought petite small Big enough for a 300 pound man and at least 31 inches long I am 5.3 had to give away. Still looking for something that fits
