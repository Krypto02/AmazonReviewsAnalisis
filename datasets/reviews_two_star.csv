2.0,"Size was much larger than expected I really wanted to wear these pants as I like the material and the fact that they don't have any pockets or pull ties, as most of these types of pants do. Trying to find some that don't seems to be very challenging lately so I was happy to find these.  They were cheap as well but unfortunately when they arrived I could immediately see that they were much too large to wear, I thought that they would be the right size since this is the size I always buy but these must run very large so that's something to keep in mind as I can't wear them and will be reordering a smaller size."
2.0,"Inconsistent Sizing I am 5’5” and 175 lbs. I ordered a large and it was extremely tight in waist and hips. I ordered an extra large and they literally fell off and dropped to my ankles. Amazon let me keep the XL. I washed them and they shrunk enough to stay on. However, I can tell they will stretch throughout day. If they would change the waste band to have more support, the XL would be a loose and comfy sweatpants.One asset is that they are warm and soft."
2.0,"Cheap cotton. Gets really pilly in no time. Bigger sizes get wider, but not taller. I’m normally a big Hanes fan, but their sweats aren’t so good. For Ladies clothing it runs short and wide, so it’ll look good from the knees up but being a tall female they’re pretty much capris and get shorter every time I wash them. Also, the cotton got cheaper, so after one wash it was already developing the little pills of fuzz. I spend more time shaving the thighs and armpits of my sweats than I do my OWN thighs and armpits! I’m still ride or die for the three quarter sleeve shirts, and always socks and undies, but I’m done buying Hanes sweatshirts and pants."
2.0,"Hanes needs to revamp their sizing!!! These are ridiculously BIG. I normally take a large but saw reviews and I had mediums from Hanes years ago, so I bought medium, sorry I didn’t get small. They get bigger each day you wear them. And what’s up with the Bell Bottoms?? Straight legs are in. Very dissappointed!!! I bought the gray and the navy heather, the navy heather is even smaller in medium then the gray"
2.0,"The Waistline on the Small is Huge The sizing on these pants is all over the place.  I purchased several pair of these some time ago.  The most recent pair was ordered in the same color and same size.  The waistline is way too big.  Also, the inseam on the newest pair is about 1” shorter than previous pairs.  I am not sure if I will keep these or not.  If I do, I will need to take in the waistline.  There is not much I can do about the inseam.  In any event, I will not ever be ordering Hanes pants again."
2.0,"Quality has gone down I've always kept a pair of Hanes sweats around for cool weather work outside or in the garage or basement, where I don't want to risk harming more expensive pants. But I've noticed the quality going down over the years, and after this last pair I won't buy them anymore.  Not only is the fabric more lightweight, stiffer, and scratchier, but they've changed the fit. The waist is now as wide or wider than the hips, so if you have a proportionately smaller waist, the waistband has a large gap, and the rise is shorter than in previous years, which makes it challenging to keep them up. A great price doesn't help if they are uncomfortable and won't stay up."
2.0,"These run really big and since they don't have a tie, order 1 or 2 sizes down. I normally wear a L or XL for sweatpants, so I went with an XL since I figured I could dry them a few times if they were too big. However, these didn't even stay up, they fell down as soon as I put them on. I'm returning mine and will order a different pair, likely something with a tie. The material did feel comfortable and the band did feel a little stretchy, but as I couldn't wear them, there was no way to know how they would've felt after a day of wearing them."
2.0,"Inaccurate size I have bought two of this pants, one blue and one grey. The blue one fits perfectly and the grey one is significantly bigger and larger. It will be returned."
2.0,"Poor workman ship I have only had these bottoms since Christmas, and the seams are coming a part. Shame on me for trying to save money. They also fit very large and have no drawstring. I purchased a small."
2.0,Double check the elastic The elastic was shot in the pair I purchased bur I needed them the day they came so I  just replaced it myself.
2.0,Mediocre quality and fit I originally bought the extra large and returned it as the waist was way too loose for me. I normally wear XL and was surprised but anyway went ahead and ordered the next size down. After wearing 2 times and laundering the pants are stretched around the waist. The Waist is not good quality and easily stretches out with even minimal wear.I will search for another product I don't believe this one is a quality product I would order again.
2.0,There is no drawstring or elastic in the waist!!! Disappointed because I have like Hanes before There is no drawstring or elastic in the waist. So I am looking for a belt ot keep the pants up.
2.0,"Size Runs big, not in line with standard size charts"
2.0,"These sweatpants run extremely large. After a very effective diet and a tragedy in my life, I lost over 70 pounds. My previous XL wardrobe has been donated, and I am trying to replace with cost efficient, but quality items.  I ordered the sweatpants in a medium and they literally fell off. Exchanged for a small (really not my size) and they are still huge.  Hanes is such a good name, I expected a true to size.  They are 50% cotton.  I hope, with a good hot wash, they will shrink to an acceptable fit."
2.0,"Size runs big Comfortable but I ordered a medium and they are very big!! Not true to size. Unfortunately I washed them hoping to shrink them, but didn’t work."
2.0,Disappointment These sweatpants felt like good quality on receipt. The fabric weight is good. Fit is as expected. First washing: what a mess! Picked up EVERYTHING from other clothes in the wash. These would make a good product for collecting lint in the washer/dryer. Horrible and basically unwearable after just one washing.
2.0,"not the same material I'm very disappointed with this purchase, these pants are not the same material as the old ones. I buy 2 new pairs of sweatpants every year, I love the comfort and warmth. But this year they arrived and are totally different, the cut is not the same. The bottom opening is much wider almost like bell bottoms from the 70s and the material is very thin not warm at all. I will look for a different brand."
2.0,Very large waist Waist is twice as large as normal for a medium.
2.0,Not Well Made Only the Navy blue of these sweatpants fit well all the way around.  The problem with the other colors is the back of the pants sits lower than the front.  They barely sit on the waist.  Wouldn't buy again or recommend.
2.0,Over sized. Not flattering.Thin material and over sized.
2.0,"Disappointed They sure aren’t what they used to be. Material very thin, tight in the hips about 5 inches too long. I ordered same size I’ve worn for years. Very disappointing"
2.0,"These would have to be my new LEAST favorite comfy pants I read the reviews that said order a size smaller. I did that. But I didn’t notice reviews saying if you have a butt don’t order these. I put them on and wondered if I had them on backwards because they seemed slightly baggy in the front and very tight and hard to pull up in the back. When I sit down they stretch tighter across my butt making them pull down and the top of the pants sit just barely above my butt crack. This is not what I’m looking for in a comfy pant. It seems they’ve been cut straight down and that the cut of the front and the back are exactly the same. So imagine flipping your pants around and your butt, which sticks out a bit on most people, has very little room and then your front, which doesn’t stick out on most people, has some extra cloth as thought the manufacturers of these pants expect you to have a front butt. The length is great (I’m tall with long legs and they come down to my feet, but not too long). They’re pretty soft. But the cut is so weird it clings to the sides of my hips to show off  all the stuff I never wanted to see and is tight on my butt do shows off all the underwear lines I don’t want to show and sags in the front. Since I got them for $7.50 on super-sale I’ll keep them as back up sleep pants but they’re not good. I don’t like them. Why 2 stars and not 1? They’re soft."
2.0,"There is no drawstring closure!!!! These fit loosely, which is what I wanted, but the waist is already stretching out after a week and there is no drawstring closure so I can't make them tighter. The description said clearly that there is a drawstring closure. Had I realized there was not I would not have bought them."
2.0,Order down in size! This item arrived huge! I ordered a 2xl n am pretty sure I got the equivalent of a 4xl:/ Moving forward I'm ordering down 2 sizes in an attempt to get the size I wanted. Seemed to be constructed well besides.
2.0,"Runs really big I got these for my Mom and I ordered a medium, which is what she wears and they were like an extra large."
2.0,"These run huge I am 5""5 180 lbs and for large.They are too big! Hope this helps someone since I have to pay and get a box and go through all the trouble to send back.  So guess I'll just throw them in the trash"
2.0,"Sweat pants I love these,but they were to large.I was going to send them back,but gave as Christmas present.So this worked out great.Thank You"
2.0,"Run Large If you are a size small 4-6, don’t order these, they run small."
2.0,"Length go the pant I brought this for myself in small, it fits me but the length is too short I am 5'7"
2.0,"Run large These pants run very large.  I should have ordered two sizes smaller.  Otherwise, good quality."
2.0,Not true to size These did not fit my daughter and she usually wears a medium
2.0,"Very wide at the ankle I like Hanes.  Except this bottom.  Didn't anticipate (from its description) the low rise and very wide leg / ankle.  I'm 5'7"".  Donated to thrift store."
2.0,"no drawstring. no extra smallHad to return them.  am 5’3 d 109, too large.pearwould be a better fit. No adjustment possible. Designed for a pear shape, no extra small offered"
2.0,"Sizing off I ordered 2 colors and same size. One is too large, and the other too small! Returning them."
2.0,Pilling fibers Worn once for a couple hours and the inner thigh is pilled so badly it seems like they are have been worn for years....  Would not buy again.  Very sad in the quality of this fabric.
2.0,I did not like the cut Good for wearing in the house
2.0,"If you normally wear S or smaller, just pass on these. The size small pants that arrived today are as large, if not larger, than my husband's medium Hanes sweatpants. If there were at least ties on the pants I would be fine with it, but there's no way to keep them from falling down. Disappointed."
2.0,Poor quality. Material pills badly after washing. Material pills badly. Would not buy again.
2.0,"Disappointed! These Hanes sweatpants are very thin, not at all like ones I have purchased in the past.  When they say they ""run large"", they definitely mean it.  I purchased ""small"" and they fit as bad as the old pants I am trying to replace because they are stretched out in the waist.  Both pairs are being returned.  I will keep looking...."
2.0,Same size ordered came in different sizes Despite the tags all being “small” 3 pictured. Each color was a different length AND waist size even though the tags were the same.Ordered 3 XL for my mother and she reports the same.Not ok that they seem to have just seen Hanes tags on random sweat pants. All in all they will work for what is intended but Buyer Be Aware!
2.0,"Too big way too big, ordered a small and received this. Waistband way too big"
2.0,One leg is larger than the other in circumference and length.  Disappointed. New sweats were sadly lacking in quality.  It appears a size small leg on one side and size medium on the other leg make a pair of sweats.  One leg is longer than the other and smaller in circumference. Keeping to wear around the house.  Will not buy Hanes anymore.
2.0,Skip this style These sweatpants have a very strange cut.  They almost feel like low rise jeans.  Not a flattering look at all.
2.0,Huge- sizes are huge The sizes were huge
2.0,Terrible sizing I ordered a medium and got a big baggy pair that seem to be XL!
2.0,"Medium is not medium I take a medium in all my pants.  I ordered a medium in two different colors and they both were too big in the waist.  I am not a small by any means, 5' 4"", 135.  I had to return."
2.0,Most awkward fitting sweatpants Way too loose around hips but tight around butt and thighs. Too short and saggy crotch
2.0,"Couldn't do it.... I initially bought these because since I have been working from home I didn't have to get dressed. Sadly even my comfy clothes don't fit anymore... MY SWEAT PANTS are too snug.  Soooo I thought these would be ticket ---- but I just couldn't. I tried them on --- and while they fit and were comfy, they were EXTREMELY unflattering.  I could not bring myself to even wear them around the house. I could not let my daughters or my husband see me in them. LOL. This is how bad they look.  The material is substantial and warm, the legs are pretty wide --- so unless you are tall and stick skinny don't get these.  I am 5'2"" and a bit on the chunky side and they just magnified the issue. I weigh about 185 right now -- having gained close to 30 pounds this year --- a bum hip and working from home didn't do me any favors.  I washed them and dried them thinking they would shrink a little--- which they did in length but not in width. I am donating them, cleaning up my diet --- and getting a new hip.  Could not do it."
2.0,No thanks The waist had no tie and was to big. Fit every where else tho.
2.0,Runs large Runs large. Order one size smaller. Not much stretch. Big scratchy tags inside.
2.0,Humongous These pants run super largeI am an xl and they are comparable to a XXL
2.0,Runs super big Unflattering fit and very large
2.0,No pocket. Way to long. Not what I thought. No pockets and way too long.
2.0,"The elastic isn’t stretchy Too big around the waist, the elastic feels all stretched out.  They keep falling down.  The material is very comfortable, and i love the straight legs.  For now I’m using a safety pin to make the waist tighter."
2.0,Too much material on bottom. Irregular. These sweat pants did not match description.
2.0,Disappointing fit. Larger size and shorter inseam. Disappointing fit. Larger size and shorter inseam.
2.0,"Weird Size I'm 5'7"" and weigh 150 lbs.  I ordered a large.  It was really wide and very big and the legs were too short.  I returned them."
2.0,Quality It looks short on me. Might work right for someone a size down.
2.0,Everything Way baggier than shown
2.0,"SO LOOSE! Not nearly enough elastic! I am a woman of 5 feet & 5 inches, I weigh 113 pounds, I usually fit a size small or (sometimes) extra small. I bought these pants in size small to wear in bed/around the house. THEY ARE HUGE! They didn't come in extra small but if they had been made with a normal amount of elasticity, size small would have fit me just fine! These pants fall right off my butt! And I've got a pretty big, fairly high butt. I'm black! I have to tuck these pants into my UNDERWEAR just to keep them from falling to my knees! WTH! They were inexpensive, so I didn't bother returning them. But I do not recommend these pants. They're made of good quality material for the price and they are soft on the skin. But the lack of elastic is a real problem. Size small would only fit a person who was at least 150 pounds with a protruding belly. So, if you're pregnant, give em a try. If not, beware. Thanks."
2.0,"Too short in the rise Length and waist fit was fine, but garment was too short in the rise (distance from crotch to waist -- in case you are not familiar with the term). Decided not to keep."
2.0,Too short Too short
2.0,I've Ordered These 3x - This Time is Smells Like Perfume I have asthma - it is bizarre.  I have to return them.
2.0,Not all sizes are right. Small was even to big. But was afraid the 10-12 would be to short.So I will deal with them.
2.0,"Material pills very quickly.  Comfortable at first but looks old after a few days wearing them. These were comfortable when I first put these on and they fit is just right, however, the material is very cheap.  It started piling on day 2 of wear and looked horrible.  Before even washing the item, there was pilling all over and worse after washing.  Every time I put them on, they feel old and they are not.  Better long lasting material is needed."
2.0,that they are made for someone very tall. they are at least 4 inches too long for me they are way too long to be a small
2.0,much larger than size chart and poorly made These are so poorly made that they are not a bargain!  I ordered medium and they were big enough for two of me. Medium is my size in almost everything I order.
2.0,"No shape to pants No shape, unflattering, long pants"
2.0,"Sizing is off Comfy material but the sizing is WAY OFF! I ordered an xl to start because that is the normal size I usually wear. They came, and I thought maybe they were mislabeled because they should have been labeled a 7XL. They were huge. So based on the size of the XL I retuned, I ordered a medium. The mediums came today and they are sized like an XS … what a hassle. So I’ll be retuning those as well."
2.0,Beware Beware that this was not the size expected. I buy hanes sweat pants alot because  of a health issue its the only pants I can wear most of the time. I ordered a small/petite and these are not the normal size small in hanes I have purchased before. Not only was the waist way to loose but the length  was not petite at all. I purchased  several colors being confident  they would fit because other hanes pants have fit me well before.  I kept them but lucky I can sew to adjust them. I will not be purchasing these again.
2.0,"Different sized leg lengths I bout these for my mom as a Xmas present and I thought she loved them. Well the other day she threw them out and told me how these were her least favorite pair of pants because of the discrepancy of the leg lengths… we had a good laugh, but if I would of known about the problem earlier I would have sent them back. I’m"
2.0,"Not so great fit These pants didn’t quite fit right and didn’t feel good on. The waist is.elastic and not adjustable, so I felt that they were always falling off my waist.  The hips were too small to go with that waist, so I kept trying to pull them up, especially in the back.  (The legs were good, though!). I didn’t like the fabric, either.  After a few hours I just took them off and put them in the bag of donations—I just didn’t want to deal with them again.  Not worth it, even if they are only $10."
2.0,Cheap The crotch area is weird and fabric is super thin
2.0,Unhappy Not what they look like in picture and way bigger than portrayed size .. if you wear a large .. get a medium
2.0,"No Pockets Pants are nice quality, run a little big, but that's good if you're looking for more comfort. My review is 2 stars not because of that. I guess it's somewhat my fault for not reading the description correctly and trusting that the manufactures would come up with some adequate designs in this day and age. My bad. But really. Why do women's pants have no pockets? The same exact pants for men are in the same price range, and guess what? They do have pockets. Hanes, please. Give me a reasonable explanation of why women's pants don't have pockets and same pants for men - do?"
2.0,"Massive These are HUGE in the waist- I cannot imagine who these are intended to fit. I got a small knowing they didn’t have an XS or XXS, and while I expected them to be a little bit big since I usually don’t fit into smalls, these are the biggest pants I have ever owned. They are ridiculously big. Gargantuan, even. The length was fine, a little long for me (I’m 5’2), but the waist on the SMALL is more like an XL or- dare I say- an XXL. In what world is this a small? Orc world? My mind is genuinely boggled. Comfy fabric, though. I secured the waist with the help of several safety pins and it was fine, but I had to pin about 10 inches of fabric total in order for these to even stay up. Bizarre sizing"
2.0,"These are SHORT! I am 5'7"" and bought a size Large. I tripled checked that I didn't get the petite. When I first got them, they were slightly short but wearable. Now, after maybe 4 washes they are a very awkward length (I just measured 27.5"" inseam, I generally need 30.5"" to 31"" inseam) so that they hit at the ankle but aren't high enough to look intentional, just like I am a growing kid. They are a lower rise pant than normal for a sweatpants and the waistband is loose without necessarily being as loose other places. The fabric is okay, I have only experienced moderate piling and minimal color bleeding they are otherwise comfortable for a very moderately priced sweatpant. If you need a short inseam and are looking for a low rise sweatpant as they fall down on my hips because the waistband is loose these might be workable, otherwise skip it."
2.0,Too big don't stay up So big and doesn't stay on you
2.0,Too Heavy The material is too heavy and they need a tie at the waist because they lie down.
2.0,Nice but one problem I bought these for the colder days since I work from home now. I wanted the fleece to keep me warm which it does and is soft. However the size is a little short in length and I’m pretty short. I did go a size down than normal since most said they run big. My biggest concern is that I only wore these pants maybe 2-3 times since it hasn’t been as cold lately and it has a huge hole from lower butt to crotch area along the seam. I’ve been pretty sedentary when I wore these so I have no idea how that hole would of gotten there. I must of gotten the defects because so far my sisters purple ones haven’t gotten a hole. Back to leggings it is.
2.0,"Pant legs are too long and don't have an elastic cuff around the bottom by the ankles I should have been more careful when I selected this pair of pants, but the pants to begin with are way too long, and drag way below my ankles. I was even going to sew a cuff to make elastic around it. (I did not yet have the opportunity as of this review date.) The waist is a little loose even though I bought a large size to fit my waist as opposed to buying an extra large, but it's still loose and it does not feel snug."
2.0,"I'm so confused and angry I'm usually between medium and large so I got a large first. Too big to even wear, inches of extra waist band so I had to hold them up to walk. Large was like an extra large... So I immediately ordered a medium. They are just as big and are a millimeter WIDER. I'm so mad I bought a smaller size that isn't a hair smaller in the slightest!!?? How is a medium ALSO like an XL!???"
2.0,"Cut to the chase and just take the unopened box to a clothing bank. I'm sure these are great if you're exactly the right size. But they didn't fit anyone in my house or my extended family. Like 20 people and no one could wear them. First, they have no drawstring, and maybe that's my fault for assuming they would. They're also ridiculously long. I mean, I'm short, so I get stuff that's too long all the time. But these are like 8 inches too long (so for a normal height person they're probably at least 3 inches too long). I looked like I was playing ""dress like a slob"" in my dad's clothes. (Except they wouldn't fit my dad!).But! They were cheap. So I'll donate them and hopefully someone will get an amazing find at the DAV."
2.0,"Shapeless & Shrunks in Cold Wash This is a basic pair of sweatpants with none of the comfort or convenience of other brands, very boxy fit and no pockets. I will keep them to schlep around in the garden with, but I would not re-purchase."
2.0,"odd fit, much brighter color these are more of a standard hot pink.The fit though is really odd, almost like they forgot that the pattern for the back and front need to be different cuts. It feels like they used the back pattern for both sides.  If you are more apple shaped, these will fit well, but if you have a smaller waist, not so much.  I roll the waist band down and they are fine for the most part.  A plus for me is that they are roomy in the leg, which is great for my bigger thighs.They pill.But really, for the $5 i spent on them, they are just fine."
2.0,"Waistband has no way to tie/cinch it - very loose waistband These seem like comfortable sweatpants, very soft and thick.  But the waistband has no way to tie or cinch it, so unless you are exactly the right size, you will constantly be pulling your pants up.  The waistband is very loose, so probably would fit apple shaped folks better that us pear shaped folks.  With no tie or cinch or belt loops, I think these would fall right off at the most inopportune time.Other than the waistband, the pants fit pretty well, a little big for the size."
2.0,"VERY SHORT INSEAM! -- instant pilling Although these sweats are not listed as being low on the hips, they have a very short inseam. As a result, whenever I pull them up and then bend over, they scooch down on my butt (sort of pulling my underwear) and threaten to expose my butt crack. I'm not particularly short waisted or long in the crotch area, and I've never had this happen with other pants. It's very frustrating and makes them less comfortable.After only two wearings, started pilling, especially between the thighs. And after one wash (on cold, no dryer) they shrunk slightly.I suppose you get what you pay for, but I didn't expect them to be quite this cheap quality or poor fit."
2.0,Fits very large.. Even the small I could have fit two of me in...and since there is no drawstring it's basically not wearable for me
2.0,Not what I was hoping from a Hanes product. I purchased these because I’m going to be having surgery in a month and I wanted something comfortable to be able to go to physical therapy in. I specifically ordered them without elastic around the ankle and that is why I made this choice. They fit terrible. The waist is about 2 inches too big the rise is too short and the pants are a little long. I had ordered a second pair which were back ordered and have tried to cancel them hopefully I can. It is more work to return them so I will try to adjust the waist and length so I have them as a back up pair.
2.0,"Big and Baggy I read a review that mentioned they ran big and suggested to go a size down, so I ordered size Small.  The review was an understatement! They are so big and baggy!  There is absolutely no waist line to hold them up.  I slipped them on and they literally fell down to my ankles.  In my case, it’s unfortunate that I can’t depend on them shrinking since they are 50% cotton.  Also, they are thin and light weight so I can’t see referring to them as sweatpants.  Very disappointed and do not recommend."
2.0,Not long enough. Very disappointing. Just not long enough. I am 5’6. Very disappointing.
2.0,"This is why they're $7.50... The waist is gigantic!  MY waist is 29"" and it was still gigantic.  I bought a small, and as soon as I held them up I knew the waistband was going to be a problem.  I gambled and washed them on gentle and threw them in the dryer hoping they would shrink.  I lost that bet.There is very little stretch to the waistband and they're falling off even after I've pinned them (don't you hate that).  I'll have to cut into the waistband and thread a cord through them and tie them up.  These are Hanes???!  Shame on them!  I gave 2 stars for the perfect length (I'm 5'3""), and the  softness of the inside fleece after washing.  Would I recommend 'em?  No."
2.0,"Waist measuremnt not sized as expected Ordered 2 pair of size Medium pants. Label inside both pants says Medium but waist measures 34.5 and 36 inches. Size chart says Med has a 30.5 to 31.5 inch waist, large 33 to 34.5 inches. Ordered Medium but measures as Large to X-Large.  Appears to be a quality control issue as I ordered a Medium two months ago and the waist fit as expected."
2.0,"Pants won’t stay up on waist! These pants were just straight without any electric to hold them up at the waist. When I put them on they worked themselves down and the croch was long and no elastic to hold them at the waist line so every step the pants got longer and the waist fell around the hips and would not stay up. I weigh 147 pounds and am 5’2” and most medians fit just right but these just happen not to have had the elastic seen right in the waist, other than that they are nice and warm enough, and I hope this never happens again!"
2.0,"Small is way too big in waist and hips Material is thin and the finished garment (size small) was so big in the waist and hips that they hardly stayed up.  However, they are very inexpensive and the color is nice.  I sew, so I decided to make the alterations to decrease the waist size and add pockets as a bonus.  Took a little time but no extra expense and I now have some nice lounge pants.  Not sure how long they will last with washings and such because the material is much thinner than standard sweat or yoga pants."
2.0,Sizes are way wrong I was very disappointed.  This were a gift for my sister and she was disappointed as well. I ordered a size medium since it said to order a size down because the pants are bigger than usual size. The pants are bigger is an understatement!! She was floating in them and the length was for someone 6 ft tall!! The pants are made ridiculously out of proportion. Its a shame because I have always trusted the Hanes brand.  Will be returning these.
2.0,"horrible bell bottom style too long, too wide, too cheap. i bought a size smaller because of the reviews, but that didn't help.  the fabric is thin, the waist too short, the length too long. the worst feature for me were the ""bell-bottom"", obnoxiously huge lower leg openings. on a positive note, i think they are a great price if they do fit you. i have other older hanes sweatpants that i love & that's why i ordered these. but i think they keep trying to re-invent the wheel, changing too many features/styles with each year. they just need to leave the original style alone. i returned them."
2.0,Keeps Shedding The pants I bought were blue.  I washed and dried them once before wearing them.  After wearing the first time I was covered in tons of blue fuzz everywhere!  I washed them again by themselves (fearing what it might do to other laundry) and again the same problem!  They seemed like a fine comfortable house pant but I would definitely stay away from these.
2.0,As many reviewers said: huge! Returned as no XS. Huge!
2.0,Mens instead of woman’s I bought a medium because they said they are for woman instead they are for men way to big. I have to give them to my fiancé now so he can wear them. I will be going to the store next time to get sweat pants.
2.0,"Good quality for price but  HUGE Good quality for the price~ like the  inside seams are finished~but they way too big.  I wanted something loose and comfortable to wear around the house and these are two sizes too big.  Inseam on regular fit is 31"" and too long for my 5'4"" frame.  Also, waste band weird and has no structure and is way too loose but may have worked with a draw string.  I plan on cutting them off and making crop pants and sewing the waste band tighter  but I would not purchase these again because of fit issues.  Sad because I wanted them to work for price and would have bought more in different colors."
2.0,"Sizes are not consistent This is the 3rd one that I have ordered.  The first pair in blue were perfect, size small. So because they were great and washed and dried perfectly,  fI ordered a second, size small in black.  They were way to BIG! I ordered another blue, size small assuming it would fit the same as the first.  It was too BIG but not as large as the second one I ordered.  I will not order again and cannot recommend these. Disappointed."
2.0,Run large Amazon advised my size would be medium but they are too big
2.0,Disappointed that there’s a hole on the first day. Good thing I have a sewing machine!! Put them on for the first time. Already have a hole in the butt. I bought two pair and am happy with the weight of the fabric. Not too heavy. Not too light. But disappointed that there’s a hole on the first day. Good thing I have a sewing machine!!  Happy with the other pair
2.0,"Disappointed.. Got 2 of them - LG. I was disappointed! Too tight waist band, the rise is way too short in the back..and front, cheaply put together. I wonder how they got passed quality control.  I am surprised they have Hanes tags (not printed) on them,  my old one from Hanes - same style, had the label printed on it.  I decided to keep both of the because it is just too much trouble to ship..post office got moved 20 miles away."
2.0,"quality control was missing altogether Ordered four pairs of these pants.  Three out of four pairs were different in length.  The first pair was a perfect fit at 40 inches in length.  The second was 42 inches, the third was 44 inches in length and the fourth was 43 inches in length.  Never experienced such a disparity when ordering multiples of the same product."
2.0,"Seriously, these run large I'm 5'7"", 170 lbs and it's all in my butt and thighs and a bit of belly. I am SWIMMING in the size L. The legs are super wide too. Did a return but they told me to keep them . . hope these shrink up a bit in the wash or I'll have to sew the waist to keep them on!back to the endless search for comfy house pants that aren't super tight or ridiculously large, don't cut in at the waist, aren't made of tissue thin crap fabric . . .  why is this so hard"
2.0,"Go up a size I'm 5'3 and pretty average, according to size chart...a medium should have been fine.....well, if you like tight fitting sweat pants then I guess they fit.  They're tight and have no wiggle room.  As I said, I'm 5'3 and have found that EVERYTHING fits long usually.  NOPE.  Not these sweats.  They're pretty much right at the ankle, kinda wanted some bunchiness which would therefore give some roominess.  Not happy with them.  Kinda deflates the $7.50 price tag, guess I'll donate them to a midget, since I no longer have the plastic bag they came in."
2.0,Flimsy.  Dollar store quality. 🗑🗑🗑 It fits like 🗑 . Wore it one to wash my dog and it had a hole in it. Washed it once and it looked worse then when after I washed the dog.
2.0,"Way too big! The pants were way too big. I ordered a small, and they wouldn't stay on."
2.0,"Either badly constructed or mislabeled When I pulled on the size Small Hanes Middle Rise Sweatpants, they literally dropped to the floor they were so huge around the top. And my waist is large for a size Small too--32""-33"". I measured the top of the pants, unstretched, and they're well over 34""! Come on, Hanes--that's absurd. How am I supposed to keep them up--suspenders?! So disappointing, since I really needed these today and paid for 1-day shipping. Straight into the charity bag they'll go and I won't order from Hanes again. Either this garment was mismade or your sizing is WAY off ordinary women's sizes.Edited to reflect the fact that Amazon refunded my money and, more important to me, said I don't have to return the garment. Having to stand in a long line at a Post Office tomorrow would have added insult to injury. So one more star."
2.0,"Great color. Nothing else okay. Ordered larger than my usual size due to everything being so small and these are really huge, but not very long even though I ordered regular. You'd think they'd be super long having ordered so big but they are not. Also, they don't even come up to my belly button. Being so much bigger I am really surprised they are so low waisted. I really love the color and that is the only thing I like about them because clearly I got the wrong size and they aren't made to fit the way I like anyway."
2.0,"Not a Medium! The pants look good but are way too large. Normally a medium fits me well these are way too large. I will either have to return them, which I hate to do, or take them up, which I do not like to do either. I am disappointed because the Hanes brand is typically well fitting."
2.0,"HUGE! I purchased the Small and these parts are HUGE!  They are not seamed on both side of the legs so it will not be possible to take them in evenly. The flare is so large they make bell bottoms look narrow by comparison. It is not worth it for me to return, so they will go in my donate pile."
2.0,"Sizing is off fits like M The xxl was waaay too big. Falling below my hips so I purchased the size smaller, which is xl. As you can see, the xl is about 4” smaller. Not what I’d consider one size difference. The xl fits like a medium and is much too tight to either look attractive or wear comfortably. The fabric is very nice, length is perfect on my 5’5” but fit on these is off. The dark Gray in xxl is also smaller than the black. I had better expectations from this company."
2.0,Depends on the color what sizing will be like. I have bought two pairs of these pants and two different colors fit differently and one was more durable and better construction than the other.  Weird because they both have the same label.  I bought the dark grey pant and it fit as expected according to my normal sizing and it has been durable.  The light grey were rather large on me in the same size as the dark grey.  They also had a huge hole in the crotch after two washes.  Very disappointed in the wear on those.
2.0,"Medium is large I really liked the fabric and soft feel of these sweatpants. However, the waist was WAY to big! As in, the pants fell down when I walked! I am a medium, and that's what I ordered. So I washed them and dried them on hot to see if that would shrink them a bit. The length shrank up to above my ankle, but the waist was still enormous for me. I gave them to someone who they did fit, and she likes them. She is shorter and wears a large."
2.0,"Unless you're a giant, don't buy! These pants and the pair that arrived today are enormous.I am 5'7"" and slender, so ordered Small.  There are maybe six extra inches at the bottom of each leg and maybe an extra 18 inches or more around the waist.  My dog and I could fill the hips.I tried washing the first pair in hot water and drying them in a hot dryer, but they refused to shrink.Hopeless.  I plan to cut the extra several inches off the bottoms, tie elastic around the waist, and wear for gardening.  Two new pairs of pants for gardening.  What a waste."
2.0,"Very Baggy These pants are OK as pajamas or lounging pants.  But they are extremely baggy.  I ordered a small, weigh 110 and am 5'5.  The pants are huge on me"
2.0,Poor workmanship Pant’s weren’t hemmed with proper workmanship.  The pants were hemmed before the inseams were made.  Waist too tight.
2.0,"Too big I ordered these in the size my mom usually wears, but they were very much too big for her. I ordered a different style of Hanes sweatpant in a larger size and those fit much better. I almost wonder if this particular pair was sized incorrectly. We wound up returning them. Also, I thought the fabric was too thin. They were more like yoga pants than sweatpants. SInce my mom is cold all the time, something with more weight would have been appreciated."
2.0,The description said the pants ran large I expected the pants to be a little large.  The tag in the pants said small but they were at least 5 inches too big in the waist.  I am not going to return them as they will fit my grand-dauughter.
2.0,"Sizing is wacky I feel like a disappointed goldilocks with these pants. Size L is falling off and M is uncomfortably tight. Where is my just right?  It shouldn't be this difficult with sweatpants.Other than that, they're very comfortable and soft."
2.0,"different than the 1st ones I ordered I first got these in gray, and the color and size were perfect.  I wanted the heather blue, so ordered a pair in the same size that I got before.  They came, and not only were they a lot bigger, the bottom cuffs were totally different too. Not sure how that happens, when I ordered from the same listing as before."
2.0,"Frustration I'm 5'10"" & originally ordered 2X & they were too big, but length was ok. Gave those to my sister. Re-ordered in 1X. Now the fit is perfect, but the length is too short.  Be nice if there was a ""tall"" option."
2.0,"Very disappointing. I used to be a big fan of Hanes' products....thought them to be a good value.....not anymore. They are poorly made, the legs twist a bit, the length is short, there were loose threads everywhere and they had a distinctly dusty odor.  I don't know what has changed in their manufacturing, but they need to return to what they used to do. I have yet to launder them, but I do not expect them to do well through the process. ... I don't dare put them in the dryer!!"
2.0,"Good value but runs VERY large I'm 5'1"" small frame.  The Small/Petite size is too big and about 4-5"" too long.  That being said, I'll just take a quick hem and wash in hot water.  I like that it's an open bottom....not jogger style.  Good value, just too big."
2.0,Wrong Color Very disappointed.  Needed and ordered Navy- received Black.  Not worth the trouble of sending back but afraid to re order the navy in case I get another black.  That's the reason for only 2 stars.
2.0,"Very wide legged pants I bought these because the description made them sound soft and comfortable. The color was good, but they were far too long and too wide in the leg. I tried hemming them but that didn't make them look any better. I decided to donate them rather than return."
2.0,"Way to long I ordered a size smaller than usual because the item stated that they ran large not only were the too big but miles to long. I would have just exchanged but I felt like, even a smaller size would still be to long."
2.0,"They fit weird These pants fit funny. I read the reviews and ordered a size smaller than usual. They were huge! Exchanged for a size smaller, which was small. Legs are too long and baggy, not enough room in the crotch unless I wear them way low on my hips and have a plumber’s crack. They were so cheap that I will keep them, but wouldn’t recommend."
2.0,Bizarre Fit Fabric weight and warmth are really good.  Bizarre fit - the waist is right size but loose and the rise from waist to crotch is too short yet the next size up would be too big.
2.0,"HUGE... nope I'm 5'7"" and usually wear a med, but holy cow, these sweat pants are huge. I received a small petite, and they are HUGH. I've rolled them down, and I still can't keep them up. I don't particularly appreciate showing my undies. It's a thumbs down from me."
2.0,Not as described In the description it said these pants had a drawstring but they do not. I was very disappointed as this is why I purchased them. They are also huge. I will be returning them and buying something in the store when I can actually see them.
2.0,"B.A.P. For reference, I am 5'5"" and 170lbs and am usually a medium/large. I ordered a small based on other reviews and I am glad I did. I am tempted to believe that these pants are PLUS SIZE WOMEN'S, not WOMEN'S, though no info on the tag states this.UPDATE: There is already a hold in the seam of the crotch after only about 3-4 washes. I walk and sleep in these, they have not been abused. This is disappointing quality, even for the price."
2.0,"M size is larger than normal I'm usually a medium size buyer ( H 5'3"", W 135-137 lbs ), but this one is too large for me.  It needs to cut half foot in waist and 2-3 inch in length, but very loose material, warm and soft."
2.0,"Not Curvy Friendly I ordered a size up as reviews suggested. Problem though, is that it is FAR too small on my butt. Front comes to the right spot, back is constantly sliding down. Unless you have a flat butt, don’t waste your money."
2.0,"Really large. These run VERY LARGE, I ordered a extra large, and wish I had ordered a Large, it might even be to big, but a little big would be comfy, these just look like someone moved out."
2.0,Definitely Not A Large Even though the tag inside the pants said large they were nowhere near a large.  I think both of the pairs I received were mismarked.  I returned both pairs and ordered directly from Hanes.  The pants I received from Hanes fit as they were intended and were comfortable.
2.0,"These sizes are not accurate Reviews on this product did note that sizes run big but I never thought to the extreme. I'm 5'4"" 125lbs. Just wanted a cheap pair of comfy sweatpants so I went with a medium figuring being cotton they would shrink a bit. Size medium was almost too big for my husband who's 6'2"" 220lbs. Judging by the medium, I'm not even sure getting 2 sizes smaller than normal would work."
2.0,"Material/sewing quality good..but…. Beware, if the waist is a little loose there is no tie for support. The waist band has no elasticity. Overall it’s too large for the size marked. Order the size smaller especially if your body frame is between sizes."
2.0,You get what you pay for. These fit fine thru waist and hips. They are a little long and loose. Sort of look like a snowboarders outfit. Would have liked a little tighter fit. Something my sewing machine will fix.
2.0,"7 inches larger in the waist than advertised These size small pants have fabric that is soft and of a nice thickness, but the waist which was described as fitting someone with a 25in-26in waist actually measures 33in.  I considered the fact that because these are mid-rise pants they might measure a bit larger as they rest below the natural wait, but the legs are also incredibly wide. I am a seamstress, so it is not as if I am unfamiliar with fit and sizing: this style is wack-a-do. In my order I purchased three pairs of sweats in a size small to find the right fit: two different Hanes styles and one style if Gildan. The other two pants fit as expected. These did not."
2.0,"Get what you pay for... I needed some comfortable pants to wear while working from home or running errands.  I ordered 2 pair (black and gray).  They were nice when I first put them on, but after washing they seemed to shrink - looked like high waters.  I hoped that was the end of the shrinking.  I wore them again and washed, now they are so short I cant wear them in public.  Since I only paid $7 each, I guess that's what I should expect?!  Won't buy these again or recommend to anyone."
2.0,Awkward Same size however one pair is too short and the other pair has varying length in each leg. The waist is too big even with cuddleduds underneath. These will be returned unfortunately!
2.0,"sizes are different between colors i bought two pairs, both XL, one in purple and one in black. The purple ones fit me great, theyre loose in the legs, fit my waist perfectly, are high rise and go below my ankles. The black ones are also marked XL, but barely fit. theyre skin tight, they barely make it above my hips and are 3-4 inches above my ankles. I don't appreciate the inconsistencies in the sizes."
2.0,"Good quality but runs very large I typically wear a size 10 which usually translates to a M … these pants are huge!  The quality is good & washes well.  The description on the site was “petite”, these are not petite length pants."
2.0,"I have these same Hanes sweats I bought like 2 years ago in a store but apparently sizing ... I have these same Hanes sweats I bought like 2 years ago in a store but apparently sizing changed cause the small regular is slightly too big, and it's too long now.  I am 5'4"" but when I bought the ones I own, a regular small fit good.  I was going to exchange them but I got sick several times after I ordered them and because of that I missed the return by date.  I didn't realized I'd only have 1 month to return them.  They were only $8 so I will still order the right size cause I like them, but I am still disappointed by only being allowed 1 month to return/exchange them, that's why the low rating"
2.0,"Weird fit I felt like the pants were on backwards!  They were much lower in the back than front.  But I checked - I had them on right.  They are so low in the back they won't even be comfortable to sleep in.  And they are so long!  I'd have to be 5'9"" for these to be the right length.  They would be so comfortable without those flaws.  I'd send them back, but they are well made and so cheap!"
2.0,Buyer beware I was so disappointed in this purchase. These run VERY big! Even rolling the waist didn’t help. I’m 5’7” and they are very long. No drawstring or pockets.
2.0,"WAY TOO SHORT WAY TOO SHORT!  The length of the pant on the model  featured is not because she's tall.  It's  because that's the actual length of the pant leg.  So you kind of ""flap in the breeze"" when you walk.  And it's a weird fit otherwise.  The rise on the back of the pant is too short so it kind of dips at the waist line in back and rises in the front."
2.0,"These run really big The pants themselves are probably fine but I ordered Medium and they are huge. The legs are very wide, the waist is big. Does not seem like any Medium I've seen."
2.0,I didn't like them at all. Not what I expected I didn't like them at all pluse they were way to big for a large more like Extra large. I was so disappointed I gave them away..
2.0,"Cheap I didn't even try these pants on. The material was cheap, thin  and you could really tell this at the hem where the material was flimsy"
2.0,"Not the Hanes sweats of the past! The legs are way too long & wide & the waist is big as well.  I have had Hanes sweats for years that I love, not these.  I get it that wide, bell bottoms are returning but not real appropriate for a sweat pants.  I normally wear a size small but these are big & long!"
2.0,Too loose. Might want to order a size smaller.
2.0,"Very long and large I am 5'4"" and these seemed a good 4"" to long. They run large all over. The bottoms of the legs are very wide, something I don't like."
2.0,Order two sizes smaller I saw to order a size smaller then normal size when actually should order two sizes smaller. If they were not needed asap would have returned
2.0,"Size down The material is comfortable; however, the size i purchased (which was a small) was waaaay too big. The crotch was weird and there was no way for my to tighten them without completely altering the look of the pants. Granted, I guess you do get what you pay for."
2.0,"Guess I have new pants? I bought these in 3 colors for my daughter who is 5'1 101lbs. She has a small waist (8-10) and is fairly thin other than her wide hips. So I bought these in a medium, her usual size. THEY DID NOT FIT. I am 4'10 170lbs, wider hips and tummy, and they fit me just fine other than being too long. So I guess now I have new pants."
2.0,"poor quality These pants were not expensive, and you certainly get what you pay for.  Very cheap material, they will be ""at home"" pants."
2.0,"Not true to size. Pants are not true to size, was too long and too large for a size medium."
2.0,"Wish I'd gotten a 2x instead of just large. I have big hips after 5 kids so the pants are wearable,  but not relaxed. I bought it for comfort."
2.0,"Read the fine print There is no way to adjust the waist. For comfort,  I usually buy a larger size and then adjust to keep them. No such feature on these."
2.0,"Oversized--Product & Amazon both Suck--What a Sorry Retailer Amazon has become!! I ordered a small-- a size smaller just as instructed, but Hanes's size Small is equivalent to an XL from other manufacturers. I went to Target and got a perfectly sized pair of sweats.Buying from Amazon was a complete waste of time and money. And Amazon's return sucks. Amazon sucks and I won't be buying anymore from them."
2.0,"Fit is not for curvy gals I read the reviews and all seemed to say that the sizing on these were running large, so I purchased a pair a size smaller than I normally would.  The quality of the fabric was fine, but the fit was awful.  If you are a woman with a curvy backside, then I would avoid these pants.  They were above my belly button in front and barely above the ""no fly zone in the back.  If you have a straighter figure, then they may fit fine.  I returned them."
2.0,"Nice but not what I was looking for I have 3 old pairs of straight leg sweats.  These are not the same.  I have the UPC code and would love to be able to match  the pants with the code to get the same ones.  Any way that could happen?  I would be be a very happy camper indeed.  The descriptions don't quite give the information I needed, so the wrong pair was ordered,  I long for a UPC ordering backup."
2.0,"Small is medium in this pant Fit is sloppy, very large in the waist, which falls to my hips.  Pant length is long.  I ordered a petite size and this is not petite.  On the positive the color is good and the material is soft."
2.0,Disappointing Description said there was a drawstring and there is not.  I read the reviews and ordered a smaller size.  The waist is very loose and I cannot keep the pants around my waist.  The bottoms are almost bell bottoms.  Very disappointed because they do not match what the description suggested.
2.0,Not a great fit for me Pants are very baggy and don’t look very nice. I applied for a return and was informed that I could keep the product so I’ll donate to Salvation Army.
2.0,The fit is off Bell bottom short pant. I’m tall 5’9. I have to wear these right at the hip or below so the bottom can cover my shoes 😬
2.0,will not purchase again pants are cheap and itchy.  size was good but they are not comfortable.
2.0,small is too big Material is nice  Too long but about 3 inches too big in waist :-(
2.0,"Odd fit, great feel Pants gall oddly off waist.  The effect is that unless you have NO curvature  in the hip area at ALL, you'll end up with a huge gap at the back."
2.0,Toooooooo big. These weren’t just a little too big. They were way too big. I was worried going smaller would make them shorter. They are on the short side but it was really hard to tell because they wouldn’t stay up without me holding them on around the waist. I’m 5’6” and weigh 170lbs.
2.0,Wide at ankle I’m returning the pants I purchased.  They fit ok however the width at the ankles was too wide for me
2.0,SIZE TOO LARGE I like the feel of the pants but they were huge.  Had to return.  May order smaller size later when I figure what size I do wear in this pant.
2.0,"Give customer a box to check not only size but also length!! When looking to purchase in the description it said, PETITE and REGULAR, there was no way I could choose PETITE and when I received them, they were all REGULAR, way too long for me!!!!! Same with the tops they were all the same size yet only one fit and only one pair of pants were PETITE so, out of two orders I could only use two items !!!!!"
2.0,"Fit large I bought a size Med. but they are way too big so am returning them.  Material and colour are perfect.Didn't realize they didn't have pockets so will look for a smaller pair with pockets.  I am 5'6"" and weight 125.Bought sweater and hoody in same colour in size Med. and they fit me perfectly."
2.0,"Elastic in waist band flips/twists Have only worn these a few times but the elastic in the waist band is now twisting within the waist band space. So the waistband itself isn't elastic just seems to have elastic in a tube. Have never had a pair of sweatpants where the waistband is constructed like this. Plus, when I bend over the whole seat slides down. These will NOT be worn outside the house."
2.0,"Ugly I ordered these for my mom. They we’re not flattering on her at all & a funky collar, kind of grayish blue."
2.0,Made to fit a boy To much volume in crotch. Made for person with flat buttocks. Fabric is a lint magnet. Don’t buy these if you have any pets. Fur clings to fabric and difficult to remove.
2.0,"Not for petite sizes! My measurements are 26"" waist, 35"" hips, and I ordered these sweatpants in size small. They were way way too big for me and wouldn't stay above my hips. Even if I sewed the waistband in to fit, the rest would still be very baggy.Other than that, they look like nice cozy pants. Wish they were actually petite like advertised or offered an XS option."
2.0,Runs large Ordered 2 pair. The dark gray fit perfect. The light gray was too long & too big in the waist. Both were petites.
2.0,"Poor fit & shape Order one to two sizes smaller, or not at all. In addition to being much to large they have a horrible shape. Like wearing elephant pants."
2.0,"Not as advertised The pants were way too large, way too wide in the leg, and unacceptable.  Not as they looked on the internet!"
2.0,Weird material Like wearing too pieces of foam with an elastic waist. I didn’t like it. The pants never wrinkled despite much activity- I think they would be good mom pants. Very lightweight but very study too. I simply didn’t like the feeling of the material.
2.0,Not for me These pants were way too long and way too big in the waist. I will not be ordering anymore.
2.0,So much shrinkage after one cold wash!! These are *fine* but they really shrank in length  after one wash…so theyve been reassigned as pajamas.  Too bad.
2.0,Too large for smaller waist I’m 5’2 and the length is perfect for what I was looking for. They are soft. BUT I am 124ish pounds and a size 26.5 waist and they are way too big on the waist.. I’m so sad. I can’t even fold them over on the waist to make them fit. I wish they had a smaller size.. sucks I’ll have to return
2.0,"Poor quality workmanship :( Got these as cheap comfy pants to wear around the house. I've generally had good experiences with James, and these fit fine, but when I pulled them out of the wash the first time - hadn't even worn them yet except to try them on! - the seam on the butt had torn out. Disappointed!"
2.0,"Way too big Amazon recommended I get a large, but I usually wear medium. I went ahead and ordered a medium and it was still way too big! I'm 5' 3"" (kind of short) and the pants pretty much covered my feet entirely. The waist was also loose and I'm not exactly skinny either. Besides all that, the material is pretty comfy."
2.0,Runs large I ordered a medium because that’s what I usually fit and these were huge. I’d definitely recommend a small or even an extra small just to be safe.
2.0,"Size Medium too big for 127lbs 5.1in This is a waste of money for me.... I ordered a medium, charcoal color and it's way way over sized. I am 5ft 1in, weight about 127 lbs. I thought the medium would fit perfect as I  pretty much wear that size. But this size M was a bummer. Looking at this size I think even the Small would've been big for me.... Oh well"
2.0,Waistband too wide The waist band seems to be a size or two larger than the pants.
2.0,"Not petite .... At least 2"" too long. Bought this for my physical therapy was thinking it would be petite so I wouldn't have to get them hemmed but how wrong I was."
2.0,Too large In the specs it explains small waiste is in the range of 28.5 - 29.5. But it is more than 30 for sure.
2.0,"Comfortable but full of lint. These pants are very comfortable and warm. However, they shed a lot of lint. I washed them many times and they never stopped shedding lint. I finally threw them away because of the mess they made in my dryer and on the sofa where I sit to watch tv."
2.0,Runs very large Bought smallest size and they were still too big. I gave them away.
2.0,WAY to big! Sized wrong 😔 Way to big! 😔
2.0,"Cheap And Unflattering Definitely, not a fashion statement - bulky, unflattering fit."
2.0,Wouldn’t order again Realize pants were cheap and cheap is what I got. Too big too short totally disappointing
2.0,Not for big booties These just do not fit my curvy figure at all. I'm used to ordering XL to make room for my booty but these fall off the hips and even if they fit correctly the rise is so low they wouldn't stay up.If you have a curvier backside these are not the sweats for you.
2.0,Legs were huge Legs were huge I could’ve put an elephant leg in there so they’ll be safe for jammies
2.0,"Description Error--Not Petite 29"" inseam Inseam on two pairs I ordered were suppose to be 29 inches (Petite).  Both pairs ordered measure 32 inches.  Will have to shorten them myself"
2.0,"no drawstring material is okay, but i guess i should have reviewed more carefully. no drawstring means they either need to be a perfect fit or they don't fit at all . my mom is smallish, but without the drawstring she cannot wear them, they are loose at waist. not  recommended"
2.0,"These look nothing like the picture! These are huge! I ordered a small..I was a small but gained some weight. But the reviews said they run big..had to fold over the top as well they sit too high at the waist. The bottoms look nothing like the picture, they r like flair jeans..I will order elastic bottoms for now on and prob not Hanes..comfort Is important when u wear sweats for sure and u don't want tight etc but these just have no shape like men's sweats..I'm going to wash them and hope they shrink a bit and prob just wear them on a lazy day...."
2.0,Not for me A little too sloppy for me legs were too wide actually the whole thing was too wide I returned them
2.0,"Much too large I know the description stats: ""runs large, order a size down"" however, I did order a size down and they are still at least a size too large.  It almost seems that these are mens sizes.  The fabric is thicker and softer than I expected, so I gave them to my husband to sleep in."
2.0,They are well made. But they don't fit right. They fit like a men's cut. I didn't care for them .
2.0,HOLE IN CROTCH PUT THEM ON FOR THE FIRST TIME AND THERE WAS A HOLE IN THE CROTCH.
2.0,"Great price but not a good fit. They are really thick. Great for the winter. However; they are cut for a short wasted person. They barely come to your waist and I am 5'3""."
2.0,"Too big. Not as usual fit. I usually wear the size I bought. Way too big and blousey  around the hips, bottom, thighs and stomach."
2.0,"Runs very large The fabric is ok but they are gigantic. I gave up rather than try to figure out what size to wear. I'm normally an L or XL, size 10 or 12. Both the XL and the L were too big."
2.0,Fit leg but not waist Fit leg but not waist. Waist to big.
2.0,"Not a fashionable fit - ended up wearing to bed I went down a size as recommended, but the style is still very boxy and not flattering.  I got a good price on them so will wear to bed when it's really cold.  Still  looking for something stylish enough to wear for daytime and going out on shopping trips."
2.0,"Hanes EcoSmart Sweatpants...stretchy! I purchased the a Women's Hanes EcoSmart Sweatpants (black) to assist with a medical condition I have. When I first tried them on they they fit perfectly; however, they began to stretch throughout the day. The main areas that stretched out were the crotch and leg area. I suggest sizing down (1) size to accommodate the unexpected stretch and they should fit perfectly. Also, I did decide to keep my pair due to comfort. Originally I ordered a size Large."
2.0,Way too big I bought a medium and a large. Both were HUGE. They fell right to the floor when i let ho of the waist.
2.0,"too big I bought for my SIL. I got a medium so they'd be comfy, but not too big (she is average height and slim, but has had 3 kids...). I ended up keeping them and I'm 5'10"" and 180# - I usually wear large or XL if I want comfy. So sizing is def off."
2.0,"Legs very wide I bought these for winter pajama pants, but the legs were so wide, they looked ridiculous."
2.0,"Thigh Rub means instant pilling Too bad, one wear and I won't wear these anywhere but in my garden.  I, like most women, do not have the benefit of thigh gap.  Where my thighs rub together, these sweatpants instantly pilled on the first day.  Unfortunately I waited too long to send them back.  I bought more than one, so the others are being donated."
2.0,"Don’t buy. I read to order a size smaller than your actual size. Not true. Size smaller was way too big. Got 2 sizes smaller, still way too big. I give up. Also, the pants are baggy at the crotch front and waist (even though I have no waist line) & fine in butt but baggy in thighs. They just aren’t as described at all."
2.0,"No pockets They're a little snug. Very thin material, but when you consider the cost, acceptable."
2.0,Way too long and baggy. These we're so long on me that there was no way I could wear them. They are also very loose and very baggy as they go down the leg towards the ankle. Very unhappy with the purchase and return them. You might like them if you're about 5 ft 7 or 5 ft 8.
2.0,"Sweats run too large, legs are extremely wide! The sweats run very large. The legs from the knee down are too wide. As I wore the sweats during the day they became much looser. I would never wear them out again! These sweats will not be returned, I will just keep and wear them in the house. I would not recommend these sweats to anyone!"
2.0,"I ordered a small size. These pants have a 35"" waistband. These pants are warm and comfy. However, I ordered a small size. I'm 5'2"", 108 lbs.  I thought they were a petite small, but the waistband was 35"" according to my dressmaker tape.  So - I'm going to stitch up the seams until they fit.  That's much easier than returning them."
2.0,Front and back are exactly the same... ... meaning that it is too short in the rear and too long in the front.  Weird fit.
2.0,Runs extremely lRge Ran extremely large-  usually wear large bought medium n still excessively baggy - huge waist.  Sizing was very disappointing.  Material was soft n color was good but unable to wear..
2.0,"Look for something else! There is a reason these are cheap. I’ve worn and washed them 3 times and they have multiple small holes in them. I work from home at a desk job, so it’s not like they’re getting worn roughly. Save your money."
2.0,Let them decide!!! Didn't care for the fabric and the fit was too loose
2.0,Baggy Returned this item. Not as pictured.
2.0,They run really big . I recommended to go 2 size down They run way too big. I recommend 2 size down other than that great material and cheap
2.0,Not desired fit It was way to big around the waist.  Length was good as I am tall and it’s hard to find a good length. Would order a size or two smaller
2.0,Sizing is unreliable to say the least. I read reviews before purchasing that the sizing was unpredictable. But the price was low enough that I thought “how bad could it be?” These are insane. The waist is so large it really is not wearable. I would not buy these no matter the price.
2.0,"Ripped after 1 wash I bought these sweatpants to lounge around the house in, and after 1 wash they had ripped at the crotch seam. It makes me sad, as these are comfortable pants.Also, there’s not much ‘fit’ to them, they’re kind of loose and baggy in general but again, perfect for home. Wish mine didn’t rip or I’d buy more"
2.0,"Size chart s not accurate. I ordered a medium. I am a size 8-10.  This medium would fit a size 14-16.  I waited almost a month to get the product, not the sellers fault, usps is overwhelmed.  Because of the timeline, aI will not exchange, just return."
2.0,The pattern cut are off They ride very low in the butt area. If you have a large behind they do not fit very well. I can'tpull them up high enough to go over the behind area to the back of  my waist.  Price was right though.I guess you get what you pay for.
2.0,Too big. So comfy. Ugh. I loved everything about them except the fit. So comfy. I was super disappointed. I could try a smaller size but the length is not even close to accurate.
2.0,To big The size chart said waist size was 28-30. I am a 29. They fell off. The waist is way to big with no elastic. The legs are very large and they are to long. I am very disapointed because I really like the material. I would order smaller but it is not available.
2.0,Larger than your size. They are too large and not tight enough in waist.
2.0,Not petite That they are not petite like claims to be that is a big difference
2.0,Too big for the size So I bought 2 pairs of these pants and I got XL which I always get. These things were huge! I read on the description they ran small in size but the ones I received were just too big.
2.0,"Watch out for shrinkage These pants were great when I bought them, but after one wash (on delicate cycle) they were too short. Had to give them to a friend who is a few inches shorter than me."
2.0,Waist is huge-no elastic or ties. Fits ok on butt and hips (areas I’m a big larger in) but is huge on waist. They had easily 5-6” of loose material there. I gave to my boyfriend and they still have about 2” of give on the waist for him.
2.0,"Soft, but will grab you everywhere. Ended up keeping them for pajamas, but they’re a clinging fabric and generally unflattering."
2.0,"Very thin fabric, and TERRIBLE Waist band I would not recommend these pants because of the Elastic in the waistband - it rolls up. Very cheap Elastic, I'll have to tack it in several places just to keep it smooth.  Cheaply made, poor quality. Disappointed in this Hanes product!"
2.0,"Poor quality The pants seemed like decent quality, the thickness of the fabric was medium, the fit was good. I've only washed them 3 times and they are starting to get a hole right next to the seam on the rear end. It's not the seam letting go so not a matter if just resewing, it's a hole in the material. Will be sending them back this week (have only had them a few weeks)."
2.0,way to long these were a bday present for my mother. Shes handicapped & was able to just try them on. They dont fit. How do I return them? I recieved them March 15th.
2.0,HUGE waist. I ordered a small pair. Waist is Huge like extra large. I wonder they have only one size and put different size tags to all. Too bad -- the material feels good and the price is good. I must return.
2.0,Pants have to be seconds Product is not full waisted. It is below belly button but problem is that it is lower in back. Your butt crack will show.At $11.00 not worth returning. I must throw them out or donate?
2.0,Order smaller than usual Good product just to big should have ordered medium
2.0,Weird fit Liked the material and color but the fit was way off from the sizing. I ordered a Medium as I wear 10/12 depending upon the brand. The butt and waist were too big/loose. Length good. Having to return
2.0,"Run big in the waist and butt, and way too short Do all clothing makers think everyone is short? What's the problem with 2 or 3 more inches in length. They can be rolled up or hemmed if the are too long,  you can't do anything about too short"
2.0,"I found this small These OK to run around in, but not much more."
2.0,No string There is no draw sting to cinch these pants and they pretty heavy fabric so they just fall off your hips.  That simple string would make these a great leisure pant
2.0,"These run larger than indicated. They are nice pants, just larger than expected."
2.0,"They shrink! These were great upon receipt, good through the first wash (cold water) , then they shrank a bit and then a bit more and after about 5 washings they are too short."
2.0,Comfy house pants I wanted those to fit well but they didn’t flatter me at all.  I looked shapeless in them.  Super comfy and warm. Nice for inside the house.
2.0,"They run really big! These pants are super soft...  but run real big!  I'm 5'5"" 140 lbs and bought a size medium..  way too big on me!  I kept them because I can sew and will fix them - for me it's easier than sending them back."
2.0,Color pretty Amazon needs to not use this company.  These pants are extremely large I normally wear a large sometimes an ex large if you order these pants order a small.
2.0,SIZING IS WAY BIG Wow...these ARE HUGE! I am 5’5 128 lbs. I usually wear a 4 and I was hoping these would be baggy but I’m not sure they’re going to stay up when I walk! I’m hoping that if I wash them in hot water and dry them on high heat they will shrink! I’ll update if they do.
2.0,Waist has no stretch to it and it is therefore too big. Waist wat to big. Will go to donations
2.0,Pants party! So comfy but absurdly large.  They won't stay up.  I usually wear a l/xl so I got xl because I wanted them to be roomy.  Not a chance... but they were cheap. Ya get what ya pay for I guess.
2.0,"Comfy and true to size Overall good fit. A lot of reviews say they run big however I completely disagree. The size finder said to get a M even though I typically wear XL. I still got the XL and it fits perfectly, no way would a M fit."
2.0,"Runs large and long! I am 5'4"" and 165bs, got a large and they swim in me and way too long."
2.0,"Not recommended.  Poor fabric choice. At first I loved these pants.  I bought them for pajama bottoms.  They were roomy, warm and comfortable.  But within 1 hour of wearing it, it started to ""pill"" badly.  I washed them to see if it would improve but no luck. The pants are unwearable."
2.0,I’m not sure what petite means in product description because these are very long. These we’re supposed to be petite but they’re not at all
2.0,"Too Big for me These must be for a man because they are way too big for me. There’s no string to even tie to hold them up or pockets. I should have known for the price, but too big. I am 5ft tall and 140lbs. I wear a women’s medium because I don’t like the tight fit."
2.0,Extremely large! I bought 2 pairs in different colors! They were my size but were made extremely large! Sending them back as soon am I can get a return label.
2.0,Too small in waist Same as above
2.0,"poor seems the product had very weak seems, one even popping the night I got them. I did repairs for a while but eventually I gave up and bought new ones elsewhere."
2.0,"Medium size - waistband too loose Medium size waistband too loose, pants fit fine otherwise. Usual size 12."
2.0,"Wanted comfortable, but huge. Did not like the thickness of these pants or the fit.  After reading many reviews, i thought these would be much thinner material.  Remind me of ""sausage pants"" if you remember those.  Very cheap price so nor bothering to return them.  Will donate them and hope someone likes them."
2.0,"Not for short women. I wear a medium and am 5 feet tall. For my age, they were too long, no elastic on bottom and bellow my belly button. Not for me."
2.0,Hanes ecosmart sweatpants They were advertised at having a draw string which they did NOT have.  No way to keep them up.
2.0,No drawstring for waist Material nice and i liked everything BuT no drawstring on wsist
2.0,"HUGE! I gave 2 stars for the color.  Gave the pants away.  I always buy M for pants, but ordered S after reading the reviews.  But the waist is 8"" too big, hip & legs are not as much but still HUGE."
2.0,"If you usually wear a medium, order small as this runs big Originally ordered a medium but it was too large and too long, so I exchanged it for small which fit better.  Okay to wear around the house.  Material is light and soft."
2.0,short girls If you are 5'4 then i would not recommend these pants.... honestly way to long and the legs are way entirely too big they looked like gothic pants on me... 2/5 .. they were soft though to try on.
2.0,"Did not expect this big I purchased the small size, and I am 5'4, 115lbs. These pants don't fit at all. It doesn't have the adjustable band on the waist, and I know the pictures are supposed just for reference, but it is kinda deceiving."
2.0,"Wide almost bell bottom legs-not like photo I have several pairs of this brand and size sweatpants. This pair is clearly a second or mismarked in that the leg width is almost double the others that I have. The length is almost 6 inches longer than the others I own--seems they would easily fit a Tall person. I'm fairly certain that even if they were washed in hot water, they would not fit.  Not as advertised."
2.0,Way to long for us shorties For Petite it’s way too long. I am only 4”10 and I can cut the extra material to make a pair of shorts. Was looking forward to having sweats in petite size now I am so Disappointed it stated petite description
2.0,"Why?! If you’re not going to put a drawstring in these, how about an actual, functional waistband? These are completely useless unless your hips and waist are the same measurements."
2.0,Short rise. Rose is very short.
2.0,Not a good fit. This is the 2nd or 3rd pair of these I've tried.  I give up.  The crotch is too short and the pant legs are too long.
2.0,"run very large To say these run a little large is a huge understatement.  I bought small and still had to cut off 3 inches from the bottom of the pant, and roll down the waste.  I just wear them at home. They are very comfortable."
2.0,Nope.... If you have a big butt like me I wouldn't recommend. They don't fit over my rump! I tried two different sizes same problem with both sizes.
2.0,Its ok These pants are nice and very comfy but super large. I got a small and they fall down my waist. It’s very sad bc I really like them but they are too large in comparison my waist is around 26 cm and i got a small
2.0,Super Wide Leg I am 5'7 and these pants had a great length. They sat at my hips and hit at the top of my foot. Unfortunately they are extremely baggy. I am usually a medium (size 6-8) and I bought a Small and they are as wide as I would expect an xxl pair to be! I could fit 2 legs in 1. I had to return them.
2.0,Runs big They were bigger than expected. I purchased a size xl and they were falling off so I had to tell them up at the waistband.
2.0,Not for me👎🏼 Bottom of pants too wide 🤦🏻‍♀️Length was a little long too
2.0,"I even went with the recommended ""size down"" They were freaking HUGE. My husband was able to fit into them since they were so big. Also he's 6'1"" and the pant legs are nearly a foot too long for his legs. Not exactly sized for women if you ask me."
2.0,Way too long I like the feel of the pants but they were way too long!
2.0,Run BIG!!! They run very big. They need to go back.
2.0,"Nice but HUGE around the waist Ordered a size small.  HUGE around the waist and no drawstring. Otherwise, would be perfect."
2.0,"They are 3 "" too long. The material looks like I've worn them for a long time.  Even has the little wear balls.  Just purchased them."
2.0,"Poor sewing, came apart and I had to resew. These are okay for the price.  The fabric is a little slippery and the sewing in the front was very poor and came apart immediately so that I had to resew them."
2.0,bottom width is toooo wide bottom width is way too wide
2.0,not happy They are made very large .
2.0,"Each one was different Not one of the three sweatpants I bought, of the same kind at the same time, was the same length, the same fit around the waist. In one, the two legs were different lengths. I was sorely disappointed."
2.0,"Hole in seam line This was a gift . When she received it, the sewing was off in the seem leaving  a  2 inch gap on her upper butt seam.  she ended up sewing"
2.0,Cheap but I thought Hanes was good ? Fit great and super soft. FIRST time wearing them and and hour into I’ve got a huge hole right on the seam.. on the back side if you catch my drift. Disappointed but I guess you can’t expect much for 8$
2.0,"Yikes. Ridiculously uneven pant leg lengths I really wanted to like these, but the inseam length was a perfect 31"" on one pants leg and 29"" angled to 30"" on the other leg.😞 They are unwearable due to this very noticeable defect. Bummer."
2.0,Large fit I ordered small and they were way too long and big
2.0,"extremely large I got two pairs of these since I need some pants to wear at home. The price was fantastic, and they seem to be good enough for that purpose. However, I am returning them because they are huge! like they will fall if I try to use. I'm 5'7"", and  120 lbs, I usually wear between XS and S, and they are always fine. This would be at least a medium size in my opinion."
2.0,medium is a large or maybe even XL Ordered a medium and a small. Both were too large and the person I purchased them for wears a medium. The medium and small were just about the same size.
2.0,"These run VERY large! I was very disappointed when I received this item today. As soon as I took it out of the package, I could tell they were entirely too large!! Sure enough, when I put them on, they fit LIKE a large, and I'm a SMALL! There were several inches of extra space at the elastic top. Thankfully, I did receive a returnless refund on these from Amazon."
2.0,Too long and too wide in the calfs Too long and too wide at the calf and ankle
2.0,"HUGE SWEATPANTS !! These Hanes Women’s Sweatpants are HUGE!  I purchased 2 pairs size SMALL.  Both are clearly tagged as size SMALL , Both pairs look and fit like like size XL.! It’s hard enough to get size small as it is.  Very disappointed 👿"
2.0,CANNOT WEAR! Very odd fit. I don’t think I can wear them but I’ve been returning several things lately and I don’t know how long I can keep it up!
2.0,Not worth the price These wear purchased for my aunt who is petite but they are too long and the boot was too wide.
2.0,"Size down flared bottom Size down when buying these pants. 5'2"" 140 ordered a M. Should of got a S. Also the bottom of the pants are more like boot cut very flared."
2.0,"Comfortable, Not Durable I would say order a size smaller than usual because they fit me so big and I’m usually a medium. I also don’t like that in between my thighs when my thighs rub, the material gets like these lint balls that feel u comfortable."
2.0,NOT soft. It is not soft.
2.0,Leg opening is much too wide. Leg opening much wider than expected and the length is a little short. I didn't return them because of the low price and they will do to wear around the house during the winter.
2.0,"They have a bizarre fit - loose at waist- with no drawstring, tight thighs and really long The material is soft, warm. The cut & fit is just SO weird"
2.0,"Disappointed Shrunk when washed. Bottoms hit above ankle. But, rest of pants where I could have used some shrinking did not. Very disappointed. Would only wear in house."
2.0,Did not meet “medium” way to large.  Returned item To big.
2.0,Runs big Usually wear a medium or large. I am curvy with a butt and hips. They are very big in leg and stomach. I would have ordered a small
2.0,Too loose! The waist is really loose and there's no drawstrings or any way to tighten it. These pants feel like they're falling off even when I'm just wearing them for light housework.
2.0,"Fit The pants were way too big in the waist. I know that the description said to order a size smaller, but I ordered the smallest size! The length was fine."
2.0,Cheap and thin Fabric is thin and feels cheap
2.0,Size down. Men’s pants listed as woman’s and too large. The sizes are not consistent. Usually Xl fits me snuggly.  These pants are 2X and too long. Hoping they shrink in the wash.
2.0,Terrible Quality The quality is terrible. I have worn these pants twice and they seem like they're disintegrating. I wore them for few hours the first time and fuzz from the inside got all over the place. I wore them all day today and the inside of the thighs is a mess. I wish I hadn't gotten them.
2.0,I ordered a small and apparently I was giving a large way too big These pants we're not just loose and baggy they were about two sizes too big!
2.0,Pants too big Ordered a medium. Way too big
2.0,Sizes not accurate Way too big for a size medium I ordered.  Soft nice quality but WAY TOO BIG!!☹
2.0,Fit good but piling The size is as advertised and they fit nice however after one washing they are piling horribly and don’t seem like they will last long
2.0,"poorly sized and a huge flair! Looking at the pics online they are far straighter in how they fall, then what I got; which is nothing more than a pair of bell bottoms. They are also far too big, and if they shrink at all, they'd be too short. I know everyone fits differently, but reading all the sizing complaints, I'm not surprised. And what's with the over sized flair? Only an add-on price, but going back."
2.0,"Disappointed Very loose, very long....not Hanes standards at all"
2.0,Pants too big at waisty Too big at waist
2.0,These run huge These run way large and they don't have draw strings to tighten around your waist. I ordered a size smaller and they're still way too big.  No pockets. I never would have bought these if I saw them in person.
2.0,Needs drawstring or elastic Need elastic or drawstring
2.0,Not petite The fit is very big despite being described petite.
2.0,Run WAY too big Ordered these for my mother. Run way too large. Don’t understand how they are calculating the size at all.
2.0,Way too big at the waist for the length that I was looking for. It is possible to be tall and on the bigger size without needing a large waist in clothing.  I will have to make some sewing adjustments so that these fit better and doesn't just hang on the waist or pull down in the back like plumber's jeans.  Good quality material otherwise.
2.0,"Sizing is incorrect! Pants are not consistent in waist size. I ordered 2 pairs of the same size, one was one inch smaller than the other."
2.0,"Has a strange fit--huge waist I read the reviews re how the waist seems large. However, since that is where I carry my weight, I thought it should fit me perfectly. Nope! I bought my normal size--Large (5'5""; size 14). Fits great through the butt and thighs, perfect length, fabric has a nice weight and feel, but the waist--good grief! And, there is no easy way to pull the elastic tighter. Got it Friday--sending back Monday."
2.0,I sent these back The material wasn't very durable
2.0,Huge These things are huge. I ordered my 95lb 5’ tall daughter a small since that is the size she wears in other brands and these fell off her as she walked down the hall. Humongous!
2.0,"Sizing is off by a mile. I donated it to Goodwill. Price is great, but way too big and long."
2.0,HUGE- buy 2 sizes down! Too large all over.
2.0,"Sizes vary widely I usually wear size M trousers, because see the comments to book S code, the results still surprised me, very big, so we have to return."
2.0,Runs big It runs very big. I got a medium and they fit like a large.  Very loose around the waist and they are super long.  I'm 5'3 and they just drag.
2.0,Too big They ok to slip on n run out the house
2.0,Sizes run way large. Sizes run way large.
2.0,Wrong product. It was a different product. Still Hanes but not the soft eco smart sweats. Kept them because they were cheap and fit was ok.
2.0,Too large and not true to description no drawstring Too large. Not true to description. No drawstring.
2.0,"Stitching coming out after 2 washes Def order a size smaller than what you think you need. Totally fine sweatpants, just what I wanted but the stitching is falling out after 2 washes. Will attempt an exchange."
2.0,"Problem with shrinkage I would have given this product five stars, until I washed it, gentle cycle, cool temperature setting.  Low heat dryer with pants removed while slightly damp.  One leg is now a couple inches shorter than the other.  Otherwise, the fit is good and material seemed of good quality.  I bought two pair, only one pair has the shrinkage problem."
2.0,"Too big Way too big.  Wont stay up, and the waistband isnt stretchy so i cant just tighten the elastic cause there isn't any.  Other than the ridiculousness of that, theyre good for thr price- seem to hold up okay in the wash and wear, and theyre decently warm.  Just wish i didnt have to pull them up every few minutes"
2.0,Size is off Order the x-large so it would be loose as I normally wear Size10-12. The option was large or X-large. The extra large came in size 16-18 with a huge waist. Was not able to return as the return window closed.
2.0,Length shrinks whe washed! They shrunk in length over an inch and were washed in cold water and medium heat in the dryer. The length was perfect before being washed.
2.0,Not at all satiafied with the purchase No pockets and no elastic in the waist didn't allow me to adjust the fit I won't be actually wearing them
2.0,"Way oversized. These were HUGE.  Quality was fine, but they are truly incorrectly sized.  Unusable, had to return them. Order down a size, maybe two."
2.0,Did not get what I ordered I ordered 3 pair of sweat pants. I got 2 pair of sweat pants and some leggins. I am 70 years old I really have no use for the leggins
2.0,Order 2 sizes down Ordered a small but it fits like a large. Aside from that quality seems good and comfortable. Order 2 sizes down atleast
2.0,Not happy Extremely cheap material! Wore it once and the bottom part got worn out and the length shrunk on the 1st wash. ☹️
2.0,These do NOT have pockets! I'm 5 feet tall and I had to hem them even though I got the petite length.  They were advertised to have pockets but they don't.
2.0,"Huge! I ordered a size small and they were huge. I’m 5’3, 118 and these pants were way too large"
2.0,"dislike these pants I don't like the fabric.  Whatever it is made of, everything sticks to it.  Please make sweatpants out of plain cotton."
2.0,"Petite length NOT as advertised Pants are OK in structure, but listed as petite, 29"" length. Turns out same 31"" length of another slightly different-style Hanes pair."
2.0,"Waistband is stretched out. Doesn't hold the pants up.. Well...I like the color and fabric. But it was a struggle to keep them up. They kept sliding down. After examining them, I found the waistband had almost no stretch.  The band wasn't holding the pants up.  I might buy some elastic and try to alter the waist. As they are now, they are unwearable."
2.0,Run very very big! Way way too big .. I buy medium all the time and these were more like an XXL huge all the way around
2.0,Too big sized wrong These are sized very large. I ordered a medium which should have got a size 8to 10. I am closer to a 10. These fit more like a 12 to 14. No drawstring so they kept sliding down . Washed in hot water and hit dryer. No shrinkage.
2.0,"Look can be deceiving These pants was not what I expected. I am 4'11 and the pants came up to my beast. They were to long, too loose, to big."
2.0,Odd fit Pants are very baggy and could be a bit longer.....wide legs and waist band is big.I am 5’8” 180 lbs. I bought the large.
2.0,"Shrinks after washing I ordered my normal size since reviews said the pants ran big.  They fit perfect when I received them, but after washing them in cold water, they shrunk.  The length is at my ankles and they are tighter.  Disappointed purchase."
2.0,"Huge waist width. I ordered the medium, when I took them out of the bag the waist looked HUGE. I put them on and they fell right to the ground. Very disappointing, they felt and looked like nice sweatpants. The large waist was the issue."
2.0,"Fit like men's medium Ordered these last year in black. They fit so well, I could wear them traveling and they looked like skacks. This time in blue heather, they looked beautiful but were so big I had to shorten them and the waist is so big I may lose them when I walk. The blue is a lighter weight material which I love but the fit is so big, I checked to see if I had ordered men's by mistake"
2.0,Way too big Size chart is wrong
2.0,Legs bottoms are excessively wide. I expected the leg bottoms to be wider than I normally like but these are far wider than shown in the photos.  Way to wide for me.  They are almost flowing when I walk.  Too wide.  Rest fit fine.
2.0,"Poor Choice I was hoping for a better fitting product.  However, the waistband on all them that I received were stretched out of shape., so they kept falling down.  I wouldn't recommend purchasing them unless they improve the elasticity of the waistband.  I won't purchase them again."
2.0,Too large I am disappointed.  I usually purchase Hanes for fitting properly.  The fabric was right but the size was terrible.  I am small and confidently ordered size small and they were very large I cannot wear them and the labeling was wrong. I’m returning them 2 pair
2.0,"Soft but Big and long Warm, but long, and large...I bought men’s pants same brand & all, & couldn’t tell the difference between the 1 pair of men’s, & the 2 pairs of ladies I had bought. Awkward fit for my 2 teenage girls"
2.0,"The sweatpants are pretty large around the waist so I would order a size down Not the greatest of quality style or fit, but for the price they are ok and serve as a quick pull on pant in the morning if you have an early zoom call or have to take out your dog!"
2.0,Runs big Pants is huge. I ordered a 1x and it's huge on me and stretches out after you sit down
2.0,$7.50...???more like $3.00 I would not recommend...they peel in the inner thogh and have only worn for 2days and now it is peeling all over....
2.0,"not for me i was very disappointed in these pants. Way too long, and i never have that problem, way too big, and they smelled funny."
2.0,"They run big Boy are these made large and long. Make sure you read the reviews and measure your body. I had to take them in over an inch on each side and ,1/2 "" in the inseam. Plus 1 1/2"" in length."
2.0,"Inconsistent sizing Sizing inconsistent. I ordered 2 smalls and one was too tight, one was too loose."
2.0,"Comfy inside but fall apart Does somewhat run a bit large. Wish it had a drawstring to tighten when needed because they do fall and sit at the hip. They also start to flake in between the thighs from walking together. Other than that, very comfy"
2.0,Very very large It’s very large
2.0,"Mislabeled I ordered three pair of these pants, the other two fit the same; but this pair is way too big. The size is mislabeled."
2.0,Cheap The seam on the leg came out the first time I washed them. They are made very cheaply.
2.0,Check the Size! I bought a large because that's the size I've bought for every pair of pants in the last 10 years!  These pants are large enough for almost two people!
2.0,Too big! They run REALLY BIG! Had to return.It was a small.
2.0,"They are alright The pants were too short for me, I am 5’7 and they were too big at my waist."
2.0,Pants do not fit properly Poorly constructed.  I ordered a size small but the waist was so large they wouldn’t even stay up.
2.0,cheap & huge good price but always too big no matter what size you get... pills quickly too
2.0,"WAY too large I normally wear a 1X, but am getting closer to an XL, now.  Ordered an XL and they are absolutely HUGE!!!  I'll probably need to order a medium, just to get the right fit! Really disappointed"
2.0,"Run larger and short The waist band almost feels like there is no elastic at all. Definitely runs big. Legs are wide and I wonder after washing if they will be too short. Got these for around the house, lounge pants... So not returning."
2.0,Order a size smaller! I ordered a medium and they are way too big! They practically fall off of me. I didn't want to pay to ship them back so I am just going to take them in at the waist since they don't have a drawstring. I do like the cut of the legs and they are soft.
2.0,Not pleased They was a really heavy material for what I thought I was getting. There is way too much stretching them. Was not pleased but will keep them to run around the house soon
2.0,too little elastic in waist the size I ordered fit everywhere but waist. Hardly any elastc in waist so sent back
2.0,Run VERY LARGE RUN VERY LARGE....
2.0,Low waist good for a flat belly. The waist is quite low and would look good with a flat belly.  I have a slight muffin top so the fit is unattractive.  The length is also quite long.  Not impressed with this pair of pants even with the low price.  They will be returned.
2.0,No pockets Pants have no pockets so can’t carry things. I will wear them around the house and do yard work in them
2.0,Fall right off! These are quite inexpensive and the fabric is nice and soft. However. The waist is about the same size as the hip. They are so inexpensive they aren’t worth returning. I will rig up some sort of drawstring to keep them from falling off!
2.0,Runs big Bought these in a large for my daughter size she is a size 10 US and doesn’t like tight sweats.  Had to return.  They were huge (like for someone with at least 40 inch waist).  I wanted them to be comfy but she would need a belt. They wouldn’t in a million years fit her.
2.0,"Runs large Comfortable weight fabric, but the sweats run too large around the waist, and there's no drawstring.  (No pockets either)"
2.0,"Too large, no draw string or elastic I had to return these because they were very wide, far too large to be a Medium. The material was soft, but there was no draw string or elastic waist so there was no way they would stay up on my wife.Maybe this pair slipped by QC.Amazon refunded the payment quickly."
2.0,"Too wide leg Disappointed. Much wider in the leg than I expected. Reviews said to buy a size down & I did, but still too loose."
2.0,"Just ok The fit was ok, but the waist was too loose on me and when I washed them they shrunk so they’re a little bit shorter than I would like. But at that price can’t really complain."
2.0,"Too small Stated they team big in size and suggested to go down a size. Wrong, too small. Should have ordered my true size."
2.0,Too long I got petite but they are still way too long. Make good pajama lounging pants that’s about it
2.0,"A bit low quality It’s been a few days since I received them, and there is already a hole in the crotch area. That’s disappointing."
2.0,Save your money Returned pants because they were too short. They fit great in the waist and hip but were much to short and I am not a tall woman at 5'3 (average height)
2.0,Not A True Petite  Length These petite  mid rise Hanes Sweatpants  were purchased for my grandmother. We were both surprised  to find  that they were at least 6 inches too long in the leg and also to big in the inseam and waist areaI am a  average  height  person and tried these pants on and they fit me so based on that I would  say these aren't a true Petite  size.
2.0,Waist to big. Lounging
2.0,Not as good quality as a year earlier These were larger than I expected. Previously purchased the same and they were perfect.  So disappointed
2.0,High water saggy pant They run really big. I ordered 2 sizes down and they are still very loose. They also shrink in leg length when you put them in the dryer. Now I have high-water saggy pants.
2.0,"Huge I was really disappointed with these sweats as they were huge. I always order large, but may I may have to order medium next time. But, I am stuck with way too large sweats."
2.0,Way too big way too long. Horrible!! I'm almost 5 11 🤣😂 and they hit the ground on me.  The waist is HUGE!! I may need a small!!  If they werent womens od give them to my son
2.0,the pants are too short and a little too tight The pants ware too short and a little tight
2.0,No pockets Comfortable fits as to be expected. Only negative is there are no pockets grrr. Still very comfortable and soft material
2.0,Too large Product was okay.  I ordered a medium and it was much too large.  Reordering in small and petite.
2.0,"Strange Fit These fit very strangely, but I can't explain what is off about them. And they are very long.  I can see why they are Irregulars.  I've kept the because they were cheap, but I would have been better off spending more or going to a thrift store."
2.0,Heavy material - not as expected These sweatpants are so heavy - I’m sweating in them after 5 minutes. Would be ok in the winter but definitely not comfortable to lounge in. Disappointed
2.0,These run short and I have short legs I'm 5'6.  These are real loose at the waist and run pretty short.
2.0,Too much pilling Pants fit well but fabric pilled a lot on the inside after several wears.
2.0,"The item itself is fine, just sizing seems way off I bought these sweatpants for my daughter who generally wears small/ petite and bought the small/ petite size - it enormous on her and doesn't even stay up. Its difficult to figure out the right fit based on the size chart provided... The item itself is fine, just sizing seems way off!"
2.0,Grande Compré talla S y es para una persona que usualmente use talla M o L. Vienen muy grandes.
2.0,"Too flare-leg I ordered these pants to wear as a throw-away pair to keep warm before a November marathon. They would do the trick, except at the bottom where they are flared too much. It'll let in far too much cold air. Sort of makes me appreciate the form-fitting clothing trend of late. Material is also a tad thin if you're looking for truly warm pants."
2.0,Way too long for the size They fit fine except in length.  They were way too long for a Small so I'll be returning them.
2.0,"Too large, no drawstring I should have ordered a size smaller. The  pant waist was too big and since there is no drawstring, they don’t stay up. The material is nice and soft though, so that’s a plus."
2.0,Shrink (a lot) Shrunk to the point they are way too short! Guess I’ll have a pair of cut offs..😞
2.0,Sizes not consistent across colors First I got the grey one and the medium got well. But the black one is so much bigger!
2.0,"These have a chemical smell I bought these in both black and gray.  The black are fine, but the gray has a very chemical smell."
2.0,"Way too big! I just laugh when I opened the package and saw how huge the xl pants were. My hubby tried them on, made his butt look awesome. Way too big for me."
2.0,Size down These run very large.  Go down a size.  Quality is okay for the price...
2.0,"good material I needed a small petite, but these were too long and too big for me.  The material is good and the service was good."
2.0,"Soft warm does not fit right These are made big, gave to my mom and the rise is not made well they ride up."
2.0,"Ok, not great Eh, ok. Good for the days you are sick and not leaving the house."
2.0,"Huge!!! Ordered Large, usually this is my size, and these are just gigantic. Seems like 4 sizes bigger than mine :(As they were quite chip, I wouldn't bother sending them back. Not worth the effort, will cost me more than I've spent already."
2.0,Problem with material.  balls of thread all over them. Problem with material. After two washings I had little balls of thread all over them.
2.0,"Absolutely not true to size! Run very large. Fabric is fine. Absolutely nowhere near true to size. I ordered a small. They are much too large. Photo representation on website shows slim (not skinny) legs, but they are very full, loose fitting."
2.0,"Bad design! Not sure who designed these, but I can imagine anyone being shaped for these to fit! Bad design"
2.0,"Nice sweatpant but way too large Nice material but this was a small, but it was enormously oversized! Had to return..."
2.0,"These are sized larger than you may be used to The overall quality was not bad for $7.50, but the fit is off. large and baggy but not long at all."
2.0,Runs very large. It's way too big and attracts cat hair and lint too much.
2.0,Not what I expected. I wished I would have gotten a size smaller than I normally wear.  They were a good price so I’ll keep them.
2.0,To big The threads keep coming out and its way oversized
2.0,"Don't keep shape They stretch out as you wear them, but aren't elastic enough to still fit"
2.0,"Way too big The length is fine, but the waist is more like a size large. Way too big for me. I’m 5”3’ and 115 lbs and I ordered a small. Definitely returning."
2.0,I could put both legs in one side. 😂 A medium was so big I could put me and the box they came in all at once.
2.0,"Very thick Purchased these to lounge around the house in and with our weather, they are a little to thick for me and not long enough. Maybe go up a size for extra length."
2.0,Not what I expected from Hanes The only good thing about these pants is the color. I wear a definite medium and these are huge. Not happy but they’ll have to do.
2.0,"Runs big for a Small size Not very petite, runs big & long. Wide at the waist....returned for refund. Nice grey color & soft."
2.0,Short Too short uneven legs . Seam sewn uneven. Not such a good buy even at 7.50 ! No more
2.0,Pants too long I have long legs and they set on the ground with shoes on
2.0,"No, would not buy again. - runs large -  not flattering these were too large, and not flattering so I didnt keep them. I'm 5'3"" and 115 lbs and the small was too large. I should have gone for an extra small if available, but again...they weren't flattering as pictured, so I didn't pursue it. I would rather pay more for a different brand and better fit. they did seem like they'd be warm if they fit."
2.0,"not good There is something not right about the pants.  The fit is terrible, material bad."
2.0,Too big I had to return it cuz it’s too big. Make sure you order a size down
2.0,Runs big The product is too big for me.

2.0,Very loose and wide The small is huge and I had to sew it so It could fit
2.0,Disappointed I am doubtful that I will try to order clothing on line again
2.0,Lined with fleece.. won’t hold your tummy in. I didn’t like the fabric in these yoga pants.. Does NOT hold you in st all in the tummy. It’s lined with fleece! I’m in Florida. Didn’t fit right either.
2.0,"Fits large Pretty color, way too big! I’m 5’2”, 108 lbs! Small was too big!"
2.0,Bummed I was disappointed because they are very short. I am not a tall person. I’m 5’5
2.0,LARGE WAY TOO LARGE AND MEDIUM WAY TOO SMALL TOO Small and Large way too large material very nice but no way to adjust waist
2.0,Grande Tallas muy grandes
2.0,"Horrible Sizing Horrible sizing!  I am usually a 5/6, and based on previous reviews, I ordered a small, and these still fall off of me. The second pair is just lying in the drawer still in the plastic. They are super soft on the inside, but without even a drawstring, there's no wearing these if I plan on taking more than one step."
2.0,Size too big Didnt like it coz sizes too big! I just end up giving it to my husband.
2.0,Size I ordered too large Beautiful pant I ordered a medium was terribly large gave to my daughter

2.0,Too long!! Pant legs way too long
2.0,"No pockets I liked these sweatpants, but I didn't realize they didn't have pockets.  In this day and age, everyone needs pockets for their mobile phones."
2.0,Product runs large! Definitely buy a smaller size. These run large!  Elastic waist band sucks!e
2.0,Sits above hip I expected them to come up to waist but they are just above hips. Not what picture showed.
2.0,"Disappointed The waist band fits as expected, but the length of these pants are on the short side.  I bought them for a Breast Cancer Walk and ended up not wearing them. Now they get used as art pants because they aren't good for anything else."
2.0,"weird fit I'm an average built women size 8-10 in pants. The fit on these isn't right. low waist and really baggy legs. They don't stay up around my waist. So, they aren't comfortable to wear, even around the house."
2.0,not the quality I was expecting These pants don't hang well.  Stiff fabric is not becoming.
2.0,"Oversized Pants This item was way too large it to be considered a ""medium"""
2.0,Huge Huge legs! I’m not small in the legs but these look like clown pants! Going back
2.0,Way too big. Didn’t like at all. Weren’t sweat pants. Just a heavy knit.
2.0,"Nothing special Very high in the front waist and short in the back. These are dumpy pants that I will wear inside the house, no one will see me in these"
2.0,"Much too baggy, sloppy! Didn't like the big baggy pants. No pockets. Boo! Won't order again. Used for lounging!"
2.0,"Too tight I used the size chart provided by the site, they fit extremely tight. I returned them"
2.0,Way too large! I generally wear a small across the board for all pants but these were more of a size M or even an L! way too big.
2.0,"Runs large Ran very large, but great quality"
2.0,"NOT a MidRise ! The waistline on these pants reached past my waist by three inches.  I'm not the tallest, but these are ridiculous. They are also a little roomy in the hips.  These maybe your kinda pants, but I'll pass.  I returned size  small."
2.0,I am short and these are so long I cannot wear them. Am giving these to my daughter who is seven inches taller than me.
2.0,Bigger than expected but warm and good price Bigger than I thought I first bought large based on waist size but I had to get medium for a better fit. Good price and they are warm
2.0,Seams coming apart. I’ve had these pants a couple months. Like them but seams are coming apart.
2.0,We ordered XL and it was huge Material was good

2.0,Too large Way too large with no way of keeping pants up at waist
2.0,"pants Order a size smaller, runs larger then normal fit"
2.0,Too large. Nothing like pic I gave away.  Two people could have fit in these pants.
2.0,"Baggy and no pockets Just 2 complaints, they are too baggy and they don't have pockets."
2.0,Very thin material I ordered with pockets and did not have pockets
2.0,"The sizes are not correct. I like my sweat pants and top to be loose and because they shrink in the first few washes I order 1 size larger in the pants and 2 sizes larger in the sweatshirts. However these pants were great in length, but they were to small in the legs, butt and waist ."
2.0,Size runs too big. These pants are way too big compared to regular size. I ended up giving them to my mom
2.0,"Too big! So big! The quality is good.i am 4""11 and weight 126 and this are super big and long for me."
2.0,Cheap and low quality These pants are very low quality. The material is not soft at all and the fleece inside gets everywhere. I don't recommend it.
2.0,Pilling after three wears / washes Comfortable leisure pants but began pilling after a few washes and wears. Disappointed
2.0,Too thick Material too thick for spring.  Heavy material.
2.0,Poor fabric quality After the second wash these are already piling between the legs. Poor quality fabric.
2.0,"Not for me! The material is nice and soft, but they have ""huge"" legs and were like 3 inches too long. (I'm 5'4) I was so disappointed! I love to wear these in the winter so I'm still searching!"
2.0,Way too big for size S It was unbelievable and puzzling. I ended up giving the sweatpants to my husband.
2.0,The top fits better than the pants I bought these in size small and the waist was too large.  I had to take it in so I could wear it.  I also did not realize that it had no pockets.  The top fits better than the pants.
2.0,"La costura delantera es un desastre En general el pantalón es cómodo, sin embargo la costura delantera hace que la zona de la entrepierna se vea horrible. No lo recomiendo."
2.0,"Okay, but very wide legs Very thick fabric and really baggy legs. Definitely not going to order any more, but okay for the price (if you don’t mind wide leg sweats."

2.0,"Very wide leg! These pants are big in the legs!! These are a wide, very wide leg sweat pants."
2.0,Not crazy about ordering things on line Not the best quality.
2.0,Not in the mood? Simply wear these pants. 😂 My husband assured me they're a major turn off. I gave them 2 stars because they're comfy. But they're really frumpy and the fabric started pilling on the very first wear. Pretty low quality material.
2.0,Super wide leg.  Sent back Super wide ankles .  Cheap
2.0,"I think they forgot the elastic in the waste band Nice, warm, comfortable sweatpants.  However, they fall down!  Waste band is very large with no elasticity yo hold the pants up.  Too bad."

2.0,Poorly made I bought Hanes because I expected a good product. But the fit on these sweatpants is awful.
2.0,Too big too long I would like them except they were much to large. I wear a medium all the time. This was the biggest medium I have ever seen
2.0,"Oversized Pants are size small, but are extremely too big. Size should be a large or XL."
2.0,"but the black color is like a magnet for lint and dog hair These are nice/comfortable sweatpants, but the black color is like a magnet for lint and dog hair. I can't wear these out of the house because by the time I leave I look like I used my pants to clear the floor of PetSmart. Maybe the other colors are better?"
2.0,"I ordered XL and they fit like an XXL I ordered XL and they fit like an XXL. Hanes seems to have trouble with getting the sizing correct. Not to mention that after I was them, the legs shrunk and one was about two inches shorter than the other leg. I am keeping them to do yard work in."
2.0,Too small All your sizes run way too small for women sizes.  Your 2X are like an XL. Make your stuff bigger...
2.0,"Awkward fitting. Awkward fitting. Pants too long, crotch too short. Not a fan."
2.0,"Low Price, Low Value This product has a great price, but is low value.  The waist is very large and doesn't have a draw string.  The fabric balled up on the first wear."
2.0,"Boxy square shaped sweatpants Size small is way too big and boxy. I'm 5'4"" and 125 lbs. and normally wear size 4/SmallThe Small top was ok but the Sbottoms have a big square waist and just large and boxy shaped.Will have to find a different brand or shape for sweatpants."
2.0,Returned because too heavy Never tried these on because they are a heavy fleece material so I returned. Too hot for TX weather.

2.0,"I am 5”4’, 130 lb. These pants are ... I am 5”4’, 130 lb. These pants are VERY big on my waist but a decent length. I was planning on “casual errand day” wear but I think I will stick to pajamas as they are...I will update after the washing."

2.0,Too large in size Pant length and fit at waist too loose
2.0,Runs big Pants were longer & wider than expected. Didn’t fit like medium more like a large.
2.0,Demasiafo grande Es muy granda
2.0,"Super-sized. There is no draw-cord and the waistband material is quite firm with some stretch. XXL works if your waistline measures at least 45-46 inches . Waist-to crotch seam is 12.75 inches in front and 15.75 inches in back. Otherwise, material and construction seem OK; I'm just very, very disappointed about the waistband.."

2.0,No waist band. Will not stay up. The waist band is useless. No elastic it draw string. I have to pin it to keep them from falling down. Legs are really wide. Will shrink a little. Warm though.
2.0,Ordered smaller and still too long and baggy legs...ha:e not worn yet ! Have to take in the kegs and length.
2.0,just ok thought i ordered petite length

2.0,Returrned Sizes run big.

2.0,"Sweat pants Did not fit well, would not buy them again"
2.0,They shrink These pants were great before I washed them. After it seemed like I lost an inch or two of length.
2.0,"The color is nice as well as the feel of the fabric The color is nice as well as the feel of the fabric, but the fit is way off. The size chart said the waist size was 28"". It's more like 32"". I'm not going to Hassel with sending it back. I'll just donate to charity. Someone will get good use of them."
2.0,Warm pants The fabric was too thick.
2.0,Very short crotch The rise is much too short for me—these cut me at my crotch right out of the package.  I am sending them back right away.
2.0,"quality Fabric, fit, overly wide legs."
2.0,To big To big all around
2.0,Runs big Rise was too low and waist was huge!

2.0,Two Stars run big
2.0,These are awful These are awful. The legs flare out like bell bottoms and the waist is way too big and falls down baggy in waist and legs flare out.
2.0,"Fabric Not Good I ordered these in both a medium and a large since sometimes wear a 12 and sometimes a 14 depending on the brand or style.  Tried the medium first and the legs were way too wide and the waist was too loose, so no need to try the large.  Also, the fabric is not soft and comfortable.  I liked nothing about these pants.  Why is it hard to find a pair of sweatpants that are cotton and polyester for under $30?  Maybe if enough people try these ""eco-smart"" fabrics and dislikes them as I did, we will get back to comfortable."
2.0,"Small sweatpants fits/ is sized like a Medium! Small sweatpants fits/ is sized like a Medium, even the EcoSmart Small Petite are way too large. I've recently lost about 15-20lbs so I'm now ordering Small sizes for all lower body clothing so I was very disappointed to find that these Small sweatpants which should be form fitting were so hugh!"
2.0,Very itchy A little tight for me but the material was very itchy against the skin
2.0,Big Way to big I could have went down 2 sizes
2.0,"Dumpy!! If you want to look fatter than you are, then by all means, these pants are for you! Look dumpy in an instant!However, that's not what I'm looking for. I bought these to exercise in (in public) so that I can get/stay fit and feel good while doing so. These pants did fit; they get a star for being the right size around my (generous) tummy, not too tight or loose. But then the fabric cascaded out all over the place in seriously unflattering ways to the rest of my legs, and not in a fun, ""wide-leg"" way. I did not feel my best in these pants, so I'm returning them.The Hanes French Terry Pocket Pant (XL) is way better, if you're built like me: 5'9"" with a tummy but not much butt/thighs. Apple shape, I guess."
2.0,Waistband size It's pretty standard that a waist of 30 or 32 inches is a medium. I was shopping for my mother here and this pant waistband is 34 without stretching the elastic. You'd have to have a waist of more than 34 to hold them up. I'll wait to try the small size before I change the rating.
2.0,Too short These were not worth money.
2.0,Way over sized!!! I am a big woman and even these are way oversized for me!!! The legs are wide enough to fit my whole body in one side! Tried to return and would only credit a few dollars! Do not buy!!
2.0,want to returnwaist  and length is bigger than same item bought earlier dislike
2.0,"No drawstring Fabric is comfy, medium weight but warm. But. The description says no pockets and no pockets, it is. Hanes should know we want pockets in our sportswear! Description said waist type is drawstring; there is no drawstring. That’s a realdisappointment as without drawstring, they don’t fit. I won’t be buying these again."
2.0,The waistband is a joke The pants themselves are fine but the waistband is some strange stretchy stuff.  When I first put these on I thought they were OK but as the day wore on they kept falling down. Use a belt or suspenders.  They need them.  I tried to take a picture but since they are black it doesn't show
2.0,"Disappointed - recommended size did not fit I was very disappointed these did not fit after ordering size recommended.  So many comments about these being made large!  I did not find this true at all!  I wear a 14 in Alfred Dunner. By height& weight, recommendation was to order a Medium for my daughter's size, who is 15 lbs heavier than me.  I ordered a Medium & a Large to try just in case!  Neither pair even fit me, much less my daughter!  Have you changed manufacturers?I was really looking forward to buying several pairs of different colors for both of us, but don't know if your able to fit us now!  Fabric was nice and soft."
2.0,"Huge!!! I bought a size 4-6 as I usually wear a size 4.  This fit me like a size 10.  So big.  I'll just keep them for wearing around the house.  The waist is too big, it droops in the crotch area to mid thigh.  They look terrible on me.  Unfortunately, I bought two pairs since it's Hanes I relied on the brand.  At best, if I wash on very hot and also toss in the dryer at high heat it will shrink them some, but I would not wear them out in public."
2.0,"Runs Large, length very long. If you are short and petite length is not available don't bother buying. also, legs are wide.Quality is acceptable for the low price. Suggest buying size down and purchase via ""AmazonTry It First"". I am returning and trying next size down."
2.0,"Don’t fit well :/ Unfortunately these are not made for people with smaller waists and larger hips/thighs/butts. They are very soft and good quality but I had to return both sizes. I tried a medium and large and while the large had the slightly oversized fit I was going for, the waist band was way too big. The medium was a little tighter than I’d like on my legs and butt, and the waistband was still kind of loose. Also, I’m 5’2 and the pants just barely came down to the floor so I would not recommend for tall people! I’m going to have to stick with pants with a draw string I guess."
2.0,"Waaaaaay... …too big.  I’m 5’8” and 145 pounds and the size M hung off my hips with hem touching the floor.  Some reviews say they shrink when washed and some say they don’t. As they are 50% cotton and 50% polyester, I am not going to count on shrinkage and will return to try a smaller size.Material is nice as is color, though.  And they are made in El Salvador if anybody wants to know."
2.0,"The sizing is off - Long pants These pants are way too big & long.  I think that they are great for tall women because the pants legs are extremely long. However, I am 5'4 and petite so they are awful for shorter women. If you are shorter and petite then I would avoid these pants at all costs."
2.0,"Odd fit Soft fabric, not too thin, good length, pants look overall OK. Bad fit for me though. The rise on the rear seam was not enough so the waistband pulls lower in the center back- which would cause you to keep pulling them up in the back. If you have a rounder rear end than flat, you may experience the same thing."
2.0,"The x-small petite is HUGE as I said in the headline - HUGH. Gave them to the hubbie and he is 5'8"" and they are big on him."
2.0,Runs large Cozy pants but they run super large. Odd fit at hip and very long for a size M
2.0,Sweatpants The band loosens up and make them too big
2.0,Too Big And Loooooong Fits larger than expected. These sweats are soooooo incredibly long! (My husband is 6'3 and they are too long for his legs when he holds them at waist level) Will be returning.
2.0,Muyy grande.. Muy muyyyyy grande..pedi xl y es como un 4xl..
2.0,Not worth the money The pants were way to big for me.
2.0,size size are really out of wack
2.0,Not true to size Shapeless and large
2.0,"That my whole order was shipped to Durham, NC, the only thing to be shipped was the gift card adrienne"
2.0,Too long Too long
2.0,WAAAY too large Returned.
2.0,poor quality This is very poor quality fabric. It pilled badly in the first wash.
2.0,"Can't wear outside but should be comfy indoors during the ... Can't wear outside but should be comfy indoors during the winter months. The pant makes me look too heavy, could be the thickness of the fabric."
2.0,Good material The waist was too big so was the foot.Good material
2.0,"dont buy if your thighs touch or rub when you walk nice & soft sweats, fit great. But if you have any issue with thighs rubbing don't waste your money on these. I've worn them all of 4 times & they are already getting rubbed in the thighs & will eventually be worn holes. Probably within a dozen wears I'd say. Too bad they aren't a little stronger material"
2.0,Too large Way too large!
2.0,Two Stars If I gain about 15 pounds they may be ok.
2.0,... the small size but it is too big look like L or XL I bought the small size but it is too big look like L or XL.
2.0,"Disappointed I’ve purchased Hanes sweatpants before. These were a bargain deal price wise. As they usually run large, I ordered a large rather than xl. I’m 5’5” and 175 lbs. I did this same sizing for another comparable pair recently ordered. They looked fine taking out of package, fit fine, and then I washed them. Shrunk a bit in fit, but usually they stretch. Length is another story. Length shrunk and I will not wear them out of house. Not even comfortable wearing them inside as I don’t like how they look.  Very disappointed! Guess you get what you pay for."
2.0,"Sizes are off. I ordered two in MEDIUM. I usually wear M or L in this type of pants (and I’m a size 10 in a more traditional pant). One was big, but acceptable.  I’m hoping they shrink when washed and dried.  The other was WAY too big.  Seemed like a size 18W.  They also have an unflattering and weird shape and rise.  But for staying warm, without being seen by people, these might work for you. But do NOT size up."
2.0,"Waist is too loose This fits loose enough for my needs, but the waist is definitely a size larger than the rest of the pant.  I'm curious to see the fit after washing and drying it for the first time.Update - these are definitely for an apple-shaped body or if you're pregnant.  They stretch out and absolutely will not stay up on a pear-shaped body!  I like the thickness but these are unwearable without suspenders."
2.0,"Weird fit I ordered a small because so many comments said these run big, but that is not the case. They ONLY run big in the waist. In the thigh area these are tight, but loose around the waist and too long and baggy at the ends, pretty much the exact opposite of how you want sweatpants to fit.  Not happy. If you have a slim build or carry weight in your stomach/upper body area these will be ok. If you have hips and thighs do not size down as others mention to do.  I should have gotten my regular size of medium, not small."
2.0,"Thumbs down Weird fit, hated them. If you like big, baggy legs and a low rise waist on your sweatpants then you might like these. They are soft, so I gave 2 stars. I just hated the fit. I gave them away. I should have returned but made the mistake of washing them before trying them on."
2.0,"Too big Model picture with this Sweatpant was slim, long, and fit perfect. (picture get from online) I ordered M size but it was very loose and big. Compare my other M size ordered from Amazon, this M should be XL."
2.0,Order 1 size below I ordered a medium for my mom who is weighs 100 lbs because of reviews and  it's huge. fits my 200lb sister.
2.0,hanes sweatpant I was very disappointed in Hanes brand overall. The sizing is difficult to decide..either too big and long or too small and short. I would not reccommend this brand.
2.0,Not petite and very big Petite to me means short. These are super long and run very large around the waist.
2.0,The legs of these XL pants are much wider than I thought.  The XL is too big for me. The picture on Amazon makes the legs of these pants look slim and straight.  The XL pants I received are very large and the legs are very wide.  They are also much thicker than I thought.  They will definitely keep you warm if they fit you.
2.0,Wayyyy too big I saw people’s reviews that they run big so I went smaller. I am 5’ 6” and 130 and usually get a medium in sweats so they’re loose but I got a small. They’re huge on me. They fall down and they length is also huge. I would trip. annoyed that I need to go return these now
2.0,"don't order if you wear petite sizes I love the feel of the pant. fits nice around my waist, a little loose. unfortunatly, it is too long and i have to return them. i am 5' 1"""

2.0,Way too big Bought these for my mother. She wears medium but these were way too big for her. My sister wears a large and they were too big for her too.
2.0,"Way too big I bought a size small and they were extremely too large- too big in the waist, legs and length"
2.0,"WAY too big i got a size small and im 5’3 and weigh 116 pounds, they were HUGE. wayyyy too big to fit me i couldve put both legs in one side of the pants and it still wouldve been big."
2.0,Expected Better From Hanes These run way big and have goofy wide legs. The top runs small even in a large. Don’t recommend- will not buy again
2.0,Comfy but poor quality After the first wash the seams split.
2.0,"Too big Too big, need to return"
2.0,"way too large much larger than expected i ordered alarge , its super huge for my sis in lawi believe sizing is way off would recommend better sizing"
2.0,Too big Too big
2.0,Cut/Fit /Rise was very odd It had this weird sort of low rise / half butt covered fit.Almost as if this pair might have been cut/put together wrong.
2.0,Not as expected I have gotten plenty of things over the years from this brand. I was extremely disappointed in these sweatpants I got my mom and myself these for Christmas and they fit terribly. The sizing was so off. She and I are close in size so she tried the smaller sized ones and they still fell off of her. They are like 2 or 3 sizes bigger then the actual size. They run extremely big. And the stiching on the one pair wasn't very good. The color was correct and thy did feel soft.
2.0,Don’t bother Run large. Poor quality knit.
2.0,fleece sweatpants it was too large for me
2.0,"Sweat pants Fits ok but what is with how wide the bottom of the legs, I thought I was back in the 60’s with bell bottoms"
2.0,"Too short, if I went any bigger they’d fall off Too Short!!"
2.0,Bit Disappointed Was a bit surprised when opened. Very wide legs and waist. Thought it was maybe a full size medium.  I'll keep because of price but will only wear around the house.
2.0,"Bought XL (my Waist 37"") Pants are huge! Disliked that the pants size does not match the sizing chart one bit and the legs, waist, all of it are Hugh.One photo added to show what XL looks like in 3 other pants and the Hanes on the bottom of the stack (Grey at top of photo) with a waist 4""+ bigger than my waist AND NO DRAWSTRING.I'm still debating if they will shrink any.I like the fabric. They came unwrinkled.My waist size is 37""To anyone that says order your regular size, explain how the 3 other pants are so much smaller than these. They are all XL."
2.0,Not a good fit Returned this product.  I ordered a large and they were too large and baggy.  Material soft.
2.0,VERY VERY VERY Much too Large Pretty color.  Very badly too long and far far too large for size listed.  Desperate so I'll have to put in a drawstring to use them.  The maker should be ashamed to make such a horrible fit pant.
2.0,"Reminds me why I don't Like Sweats As others have reviewed, the sizing is off and I partially blame the photo.  IMO, the photo shows a ""relaxed"" fit so I'd recommend a size down for something that fits more ""as expected.""Personally?  I'm not a fan of sweats.  I bought these to avoid using a blanket to keep my legs warm in the winter.  This will be a one season and done purchase for me that I'll then donate.10/16/20 Update:  On Amazon for a really great price so I bought another pair for this season.  Went with a size smaller and they fit like 2 sizes smaller."
