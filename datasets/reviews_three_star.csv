3.0,"Always wear an xl but these were too big! I ordered three pair, tried one on when I first got them. That pair fit but was a little loose. I thought they would be ok after washing. I bought them to wear when we moved to our new home in Colorado. When we got settled after the move I got them out to wear and they were too big. The original pair I tried fit loosely but I can still wear them but the gray pair was so big they slide down my hips. I think the size is mismarked.I wanted to send them back but it was after the return date. Also the legs are very wide and look weird!"
3.0,"These are so funny I'm keeping them. Basically the price was right. But you also get what you pay for, right? I wear a medium and these fit, but not like any medium sweatpants I've had before. I'm an average height. (5'-6.5"") They are far too long legged. I'm actually stepping on them. The waistband is just slightly loose and NO drawstring. And they're kind of short in the crotch. After I wash them, maybe the length will be better. If not I can hem them, no problem. Hopefully the crotch won't change much. I do like the weight of the fabric and the soft inner side. I'll make them work. But they really are poorly designed. (in my opinion)"
3.0,"FIT VARIES ACCORING TO COLOR OF ITEM I have a couple of old Hanes sweatpants that I have worn for a long time.  I wanted to replace them.  I am very long-waisted, so most pants don't fit me.  I ordered these sweatpants in the following colors:  black, navy blue, and gray (all in a medium size).  As usual, the pants fit more on my hips than my natural waist.  The black fit me like a medium, except it really doesn't have enough room in the crotch area because of my long waist.  However, the blue and gray were too big in the waist.  All of the pants seemed a little long.  These pants don't fit as well as my old ones; also, they are more light weight than the older Hanes product.  I will wear these pants when I walk the dogs, but they aren't really that comfortable to lounge around in at home."
3.0,"Too big These were way too big by at least one size. I will only wear around the house, so it‚Äôs not a big deal, but won‚Äôt purchase again."
3.0,"Order smaller than what you think you need They are comfortable but too long as well. Waist was especially huge. I suppose I may get fatter, but I'm certain I won't get taller."
3.0,Not a good fit The waist is much too wide for me.  I bought Medium and would have done better with Small.
3.0,Warm The fabric is warm and smooth ‚Ä¶.. but size description is not good. Sadly had to return this
3.0,Disappointed This was not the same as I had ordered before.  I thought it was.  The quality didn‚Äôt measure up.  My fault for not being more careful in ordering.
3.0,"3"" the left leg on the purple pair is at least three inches wider then the right leg. took a bit to notice, won't be wearing these outside üòÇneighbor asked if i made them myself ü§£the gray pair does not have this issue"
3.0,Very scratchy fabric The fabric was scratchy even after washing and using fabric softener.  Would not recommend if you are looking for soft and comfortable lounging pants.
3.0,"Correction. The pants were advertised with no drawstring. My apologies Correction. The pants were advertised W/O a drawstring. My error and I need to correct it. They do run large, however, and are sort of soft. I got a Medium, which I was told would fit. It was Big. The legs are loose, which is what I wanted and I'll be ordering one more pair in small to see if it is the right size. Once again, my error, though there are many pants which do have a drawstring that looked good."
3.0,"These run very large. The large were really large. They might have shrank in the dryer, but I didn't want to assume that.They are pretty thick; they feel like a new hoodie, but the inside is very soft, cozy."
3.0,"nice but... nice product, nice fabric, nice comfort but WAY too big...reordered 2 sizes down, we'll see what happens"
3.0,The waist size It‚Äôs to big very loose
3.0,Too short These are extremely short. I‚Äôll just cut off the legs and make shorts and I haven‚Äôt even washed them yet.
3.0,Runs big I had to return bc these pants runs big. Warm. A good value.
3.0,"Bare elastic waist I like these pants a lot, but as someone allergic to latex/elastic, I have to make sure my pajama top is always tucked in so I don't get a rash. Needless to say, this makes them a lot less comfortable for me than for others.They'll do for now, but I won't be buying another pair."
3.0,"Runs large!!! I ordered an XL because I wanted to be comfortable ... I swam in them!  I think a M might be a better choice, even though I usually buy XL."
3.0,Long These were a little big
3.0,These seem to be seconds. They're very nice but the waistband has barely any stretch to it. They seem like factory seconds to me. For the price they're ok if you don't mind a loose waistband.
3.0,"waaay bigger than expected I am usually a large in hanes underwear so I ordered a medium since the fit runs big.. Yeah, no. Way too big/long. Nice fabric but terrible fit/cut."
3.0,Runs very large. Well made but size down 1-2 sizes.
3.0,Shrinkage I bought this for my elderly mom as well as the sweatshirts. The clothing we‚Äôre comfortable but too small. She was also concerned that the products might shrink after being washed (she was sure of it)
3.0,Hanes ComfortSoft EcoSmart Women's Open Bottom Leg Fleece Sweatpants Hanes ComfortSoft EcoSmart Women's Open Bottom Leg Fleece Sweatpants.  The waistband is too large. The pants did not wash well. The pants are long and baggy.  The waist is way too big. I would not buy these pants again.
3.0,"These aren‚Äôt up to Hanes normal quality I have always owned Hanes sweatpants/shirts, but I was very disappointed in these. They did not wash up nicely and the left fuzz balls all over them."
3.0,They are very comfortable for around the house. Thes pants are wide all the way to the bottom like stovepipe. They are wearable around the house but not what I expected. I do wear them around the house.
3.0,"does not fit. I ordered 3 pair of these pants and the first two pairs I received fit just right, the last pair (gray) are much too big, I ordered all 3 pairs the same size.  WHY ARE THEY NOT ALL THE SAME SIZE?  Helen R Wymer."
3.0,Not as described Waist does not have drawstring as is indicated in description - enclosed elastic with no ability to tighten. No pockets but knew that when ordering. Still a good value though.
3.0,Fair quality Washes well
3.0,Good enough for the price Decent enough quality but these pants have like elephant legs. They are so wide.  I ordered a large. I am 5'4 about 157lbs. I wanted them loose. These pants have exceptionally wide legs. I could have easily fit in a medium.  But they are ok for lounging.
3.0,not what i thought it would be well i know these pants have a great rating BUT theres somethings people havent mentioned....like there is NO drawstring or any way to make sure the pants dont fall down! sure they are nice & fuzzy & warm yet i have to fold the waistband over to keep them up. they are kinds disappionting.....
3.0,"Too short I received the sweatpants, and when I tried them on, they fit great. However, they we‚Äôre too short, so I retured them."
3.0,"Thin material, pants too short! These pants were made for very short people!  They looked like capris on my 5‚Äô9‚Äù frame.  In addition, the material was very thin and not really warm at all."
3.0,Gave these to my sister plus size xlg..more like a size 18-20 in women Good quality but I got them in plus size not women's lg... Gave to my sister they fit her great shes 18-20
3.0,Would better with pockets. Needs pockets
3.0,Feel different from earlier buys. These looked and fit oddly. Returned.
3.0,"Way too big!! The size chart for a size Large says it fits a 33-34.5"" waist.  The actual measured waist size was 40"", and that was without any stretch in the elastic !!"
3.0,"Only One BIG Complaint I've been buying this pant for three years. Loved it until the last 3 pairs. I am 5'5"" and 140 lbs. A small always has been great, but suddenly the length between the back waist and crotch is so short that they won't pull all the way up. Since returns mean driving 30 miles, I've had to give the last 3 brand-new pairs away. Ordering a medium would be too large since they run big. Not trying them again. It isn't just a fluke. It's an error in fit."
3.0,"Lacks drawstring as pictured. No drawstring.  I expect this to be a problem in the future.  Realistically, losing a few inches or the waist stretching from use, will cause  e to throw this pant away.  ü´§"
3.0,The size is larger than normal Size is off
3.0,Poor quality. Material pills after washing. I don't recommend. Hanes quality is not as good as the use to be.
3.0,"They DO NOT have a drawstring waist I recently broke my ankle and am stuck wearing open legged pants/sweats to go over the cast.  I ordered these specifically because the description says ""drawstring closure"" so that the pants would stay in place and not fall down.I received the blue and the gray and neither pair has a drawstring waist.  That is not a viable option.  They are nice sweats, but I cannot have pants falling down or getting under the ""good"" foot while on crutches."
3.0,Comfortable but too big. I went by the size guide and I measured for a medium. Should have ordered a small. They are huge. Super long and baggy. Order a size down if you order these. The the fabric is soft so that is a plus.
3.0,"Order a size down.. I ordered a small, but these pants are like medium.. They‚Äôre super comfy though & I share comfy pants with my partner so they‚Äôll work.. just a little big"
3.0,"Comfortable, but... Very comfortable pant. However, after the first wash it shrunk up a couple inches in length. Won't buy again."
3.0,Inseam too long I would love it if the maker made these to fit and add in an inseam length for short women.
3.0,Size is large In general I like the pants but word of warning they fit very large.I went down two sizes
3.0,"Ok sweatpants The pants fit in the hips, but the waist is too big. There is elastic in the waist band, but no ties to tighten it. I‚Äôm going to put some ties in and that should make them fit better."
3.0,These are for around the house! They are comfortable and they do stretch.  The only problem is no pockets.
3.0,Seams unravel I have owned 6 pair over the past few years. This is the first pair made shoddily. The seam holding the 2 halves together unraveled after wearing once. Very disappointed üòû
3.0,"These are low waisted You can wear these pants out to the store; they don't really look like sweats. They're low waisted. I usually like xlarge sweats to be comfy, but got the large, which do fit, but like pants, not loose fitting sweats. If you want lounge around the house slobby pants, get your regular size. Otherwise, go a size down. I've got a tummy, btw."
3.0,"These are shortlisted. Don't order if you don't like hip huggers! Look like they would be warm, but they don't come all the way to your waist."
3.0,Not sweatpants They are very thin for being sweatpants. More like a casual pant.
3.0,Fit has changed The rise on these seems shorter than when I have purchased them in the past
3.0,"Way too big at the waist I'm 5'2 and weigh around 117 lb. I read the reviews and figured the waist couldn't be THAT much bigger but man was I wrong. I got a small size (4-6) which is what I always get. So, unless you can tailor the waist, you're better off not getting it if your body is similar to mine. Also, it is quite long."
3.0,"Too large Ordered a lg., way too big & didnt like design."
3.0,"Warm but loose On the plus side the fabric is soft, thick, and warm. On the negative (for me) the rise is definitely shorter than shown in photo and the waistband is so loose I will have to put in my own drawstring to hold them up. Otherwise they fit fine."
3.0,No way to tighten Too big and no way to tighten
3.0,Sweatpants Comfy like pajamas.
3.0,See through It‚Äôs stretchy and was the perfect length for my leg(my legs are shot tho so taller people might find a problem). I got white and it was see through fully but I think a different color would have been good.
3.0,The large is very big They are too big
3.0,They are too big not small at all Too big
3.0,No pockets Sweats with no pockets!  Bummed me out!
3.0,Comfy Comfy. Small size was still too big.
3.0,"They're comfortable but... The Hanes brand is no longer a brand of quality and hasn't been for years. I bought 2 pair the same size and they are different lengths. This is common with ALL Hanes clothing. Unreliable, cheap material, and they don't last."
3.0,"Too short These were definitely not a 31‚Äù inseam. I wear a 28‚Äù inseam, and these were too short on me."
3.0,Too loose Elastic waist band is too loose. They slip down all the time.
3.0,Size runs big and tall. This item is huge. Is not as high waisted as picture shows.
3.0,what is a 1x elsewhere is a little too big at amazon when ordering get a size smaller
3.0,"Runs Big I'm 112 and 5'4, 24 in waist. These don't fit. I'll just keep them to wear at home as they are comfortable and super warm. However, definitely can't wear them outside the house. I wish they had a draw string as that would've made them perfect!"
3.0,No pockets and the waist band is too large Bought them for walking. I have to hike them up because they slip down after a while. I wear them around the house. I should have returned them.No pockets.
3.0,smallest size too big the smallest size only fit on me if i fold down the waist which sucks but they r comfy so. just wish they fit better.
3.0,"NO DRAWSTRING - RUNS LARGE In Product Description it States the Sweats have a Draw String Along w/Elastic, Only has Elastic Waistband; Run Large, Have to fold down the Waistband or they will fall off; Typical Sweat Pants If you are looking for Sweats that are Flattering Pick a Different Type!"
3.0,"Most comfy, linty & pilling sweatpants ever I ordered medium and large. I'm 5'4"" 250, don't have a big butt so the mediums fit well if not perfect, I even have a little extra room. The large fit ok but are too long for my height and I can pull them over my stomach because of so much extra room in the waist area. I prefer the medium as they sit/fit comfortably on my hips. With that said, these definitely run large.+Uber-comfortable, soft+I like the fit, easy to move about+Not too long+Wide pant legs (I suffer from large calves)+I don't overheat in them, breathable-Lint galore. *****Do not ever wash these with other clothes.***** The lint comes from the inside fleece part which I'm sure will degrade the sweatpants. Two pairs of these sweatpants accumulated a tennis ball sized lint ball-Pilling is horrible in the inner thigh. Noticed after the first use, only gets worse-I knew going in these had no pockets, but yeah they have no pockets or drawstrings-The seam on most of my pants aren't properly aligned (you can see it in the picture on the right leg)I've never been a sweatpants gal but these have won me over because of the comfort and fit. Just wish they didn't pill because I won't get many uses out of these before they're too embarrassing to wear with all the inner thigh material rolling into balls."
3.0,"Poor waist design. Elastic waistband uncomfortable. I dislike these sweats, mostly because of the elastic at the waist. It's a flat, very wide strip of elastic, and it's not sewed inside the cloth. It's right out there, exposed, and rather rough, and if you wear it next to your skin, it can be uncomfortable. I'm about 5'4.5"", 120--125 pounds, and this is medium size.The length is ok, not long enough to drag. The pants hit the top of my feet, but not by much. This seems the right size for me. The waistband is not too tight on me, but it keeps pulling the pants upward, so the rise often feels too short. I think the waist is poorly designed. Elastic should be narrow and covered by cloth, and this elastic is probably much too wide. That seems to cause the problem with pulling upward. But you might have different results.I don't like the open bottom, but just thought I'd try it. A stretchy cuff feels a lot neater. I'm going back to men's sweatpants with a waist cord that you can adjust, or internal elastic waist, and stretchy cuff at the bottom. Probably won't return these, since it's a hassle. The material is moderately soft and warm, so I'll just use them.I have slightly wide hips, but within normal range, and that may be the problem with the waistband. But many women have relatively wide hips compared to waist. Poorly designed, IMO."
3.0,Poor Quality I have had this item for less than a month and. the waist band and the seam in the crotch are already coming apart and needed mending.
3.0,Pant legs are too short I m 5‚Äò 10 and pants are way too short. They are barley above my ankle.
3.0,RUNS LONG Bought small but length was still too long. Take caution if you're on the shorter side or just go buy petite.
3.0,Very large Very unflattering
3.0,"Waaaay tooooo big Very large.  I normally wear a large, but these were about 3 times too big for me and very very long."
3.0,sw ok
3.0,Split at seams Ripped at seams and they fit. We‚Äôre a bit snug but fit and split
3.0,"Too big Too big, and advertised having a draw string closure. Strictly was elastic waistband.  Material too thin."
3.0,A little too XL I bought my daughter an XL.  Up until now everything I've bought her in that size has fit.  These may be a couple sizes too big.
3.0,Length is great but definitely downsize 2 sizes The sizing is really off. I‚Äôm usually a medium/large  and i got the smallest size available. It was still a little big but very comfortable. The pilling is pretty bad around the thighs.
3.0,the legs are very baggie This is an ok product --- the legs of the pants are baggie
3.0,These pants are huge! Too big!
3.0,"Very big The size small is quite large, more like a medium in other brands."
3.0,Way too big Way too large
3.0,Not the same pants I ordered before They we're not the pants I had ordered before they were just real baggy no shape
3.0,Fabric thinner than expected Fabric thinner than expected
3.0,"Bought 4 pairs but page does not allow individual reviews 5 stars to pink and gray, do not buy black Pink XL Petite, Heather Gray XL Petite for my mother. Great value! The length was good for her, she is 5 feet tall. The pink is very vibrant, the gray is as pictured. For those 2 pairs I give 5 STARS and recommend buying, and was so happy to find a good length for her that did not drag or pool at the ankle which is extra important for seniors who are prone to falls and love that these are made from recycled materials. GOOD!I also purchased a L BLACK (regular) and an XL BLACK petite. Those deserve 0 STAR, they shed, the color runs and stains as seen in other reviews. DO NOT BUY THE BLACK! The black should be pulled off the market for Quality Control issues. The Large Regular pair was for me, there was not enough fabric in back/half coverage, they slid down, waist circumference was huge, yet they did not cover the bum! I tried reversing them, and it was worse! The front was huge and went far above the navel, and pouched, I don't think the cut would even work for a man. Weirdest cut ever!"
3.0,To wide at the bottom. Very comfortable. Fit well at the waist. Very large leg opening at the bottom. I prefer a more tapered leg opening.
3.0,Cheaply made Cheap
3.0,"Perfect for a lazy day at home Not as heavy as I thought, not quite as warm.ok for fall not warm enough for winter"
3.0,I should have gotten my size From the reviews I decided to go a size smaller and they didn‚Äôt fit well‚Ä¶ next time I‚Äôll just get my size because they didn‚Äôt even go down to my ankles
3.0,"They‚Äôre ok with a little help. They‚Äôre warm. But it came with an elastic band. For me that didn‚Äôt work. I had bought them bigger than my size. They were so cheap I decided to find a way to make it so I can use them without them falling down. So I made a little hole right in front. (I bought a gadget I found on Amazon.)  Where you can thread the drawstring through the waistband. Then pull it through! I found the drawstrings on Amazon also. I sewed a little seam around the hole I cut to insert the drawstring. So it wouldn‚Äôt unravel. The thing that I really don‚Äôt like is that the inside of the pants sheds. Big time. On socks etc. but I decided to try washing it , but I put it in a washing bag inside out. Hoping that it sheds inside the bag. It didn‚Äôt shed in the bag but they aren‚Äôt shedding on my socks. Maybe just washing them did it. I also ran it through the dryer.  Brand is Hanes."
3.0,legs too wide at bottom like old bell bottoms at leg bottom.  have too sew to wear
3.0,"Huuuuuge! Originally purchased a large based on measurements listed on the product. Based on the measurements from the chart, I would be a large waist and medium hip. The large could have fit two of me in them. Exchanged for a small which are still too big, but they aren't completely falling off now at least. Bought these for my mom who is not much bigger than myself, so they should stay up on her better. I'm 5'3"" and about 152 lbs with about a 33"" waist and 41.5"" hips. Small is plenty big for someone my size, and I had jeans on when I put these on over them just to quickly check the size. Definitely order at least 1, but probably 2 sizes smaller than you think you need."
3.0,"They were floods on me! I am 5‚Äô6 130lbs. They were floods on me, had to pull them down and stretch the legs out in order for them to look right. Other then that they do keep you warm!"
3.0,"Great quality fabric, but no way to keep the pants up The fit is very large and there's no way to keep the pants up. There is no elastic in the waistband, it's just folded and sewn, so it will stretch larger and larger, but there's no way for it to snap back at your waist. These are probably great for those with a round, apple figure, but not if your waist is the same size or smaller than your butt/hips.Very nice fabric, soft and smooth, and thick enough that the pants don't look or feel cheap. Length was good for me (31"") but the lack of a waistband meant I had to return them."
3.0,Material not liking Just not what expected
3.0,Legs are very wide The legs are very wide and I didn't notice when I ordered them that there are no pockets.  Disappointed.
3.0,Huge 110 lbs with a pull on and still too large
3.0,a few important features missing I was unhappy no drawstring or stretch elastic at waist. this would keep me from ordering them again.
3.0,"A bit baggy and loose fitting, not the most flattering - but lightweight and easy to dry! As title suggests, they're a bit baggy and loose, even though I ordered my regular size (M). The cut doesn't flatter too well, not that I expect a lot from sweatpants :) I ended up going to return them, but Amazon told me to keep. I'd consider them a decent length for 5ft 6-9in people. They ended up being very lightweight and easy to dry, so a good choice for around the house or for short errands."
3.0,"medium seemed to be too big? They looked nice but were too big for my wife length and massive waist which was a problem because there were no draw strings so they fell down. But I would say for the price they were a good deal, just not the right fit for my wife. My guess is that a person would need to be around 18-19 across for these to stay up. The elasticated waistband  is not that good(it seems) but then I‚Äôm not wearing them! Other than that I would say for the price they are quite well made. My wife is very slim and about 5ft tall so they were way too long for her anyway."
3.0,"waist way to big The pants, as pictured and described, were what I was looking for. I wanted simple sweat pants that fit at the waist, not around the hips. But, when they came, that is exactly where they stopped. And the ""waistband"" (or I should call it a ""hipband"") was way too big for me. Nice big gap there. Fit fine in the lower part of the hips. Length was right at the ankle. I wish they were a little longer, but that was okay.  I ordered a medium, which is what I usually wear. I have worn Hanes before, and really expected something that fit. I returned them."
3.0,"Not what I expected When I first got it, it was not what I expect as this pants does not fit comfortably to be above my belly button, it is just in between my hip and below my belly button which I do not like.  But it will do for now."
3.0,"Were great the first two wears, then pilled terribly These were great the first couple of wears, then they started pilling and all of the lining started coming off on the inside. You will feel a bump on your leg and realize there is a lump of lining in your pants. terrible quality. I loved them so much the first day I bought a second pair. They did the same thing. You won't get but a few wears out of them before this happens, :("
3.0,"Too large and too short. I‚Äôm very disappointed by this purchase, but it‚Äôs partly my fault for not reading the reviews first. These pants run a size larger than they should be.I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9‚Äù and 240 lbs and normally wear an XXL in sweatpants. These pants are just too loose in the waist which could have easily been remedied with a drawstring. I likely will add one myself. Also, the inseam is too short for my personal comfort. If it were an inch longer, the length would be fine, but there‚Äôs not much I can do without adding an inch of fabric myself or shortening them into capris. So tall ladies, don‚Äôt waste your time or money on these."
3.0,Big in waist I like everything about these pants except they run big in the waist. I usually wear size 6 so ordered a small. They fit okay in the hips but waist is very loose even after washing once. Maybe it‚Äôs just my body shape and would fit others better. I decided not to return and just wear my shirts untucked. They are worth it for the price.
3.0,"These run large, I have to wear them above my waist and the length for a 5'1"" in Med is too long. These are very comfortable and lined in a light fleece, smooth surface on outside.  I bought a Med and it is too big and too long so I am going to order a small and hope it will be perfect. These bigger ones will be fine if I pull them way up and then I will have to shorten them and they'll be fine for lounging around. Great price.I ordered again and got small and they are still pretty big and really long however I don't have to pull them up to past my waist with the small."
3.0,"Great Price, Good Quality, Terrible Fit The Hanes Women's EcoSmart Open Bottom Leg Sweatpants were only $9.98.  The material is good quality and the fleece lining is soft.  They would be a wonderful bargain if they had a decent fit.  The description said they run large.  I am 5'8"" and weigh 122 pounds and bought size small.  The pants are so loose at the waist that they ride down.  I don't have a sewing machine and having them altered would probably cost more than the pants.  I did my best with hand sewing but have to use a binder clip to keep them up."
3.0,"Comfy but not super stylish These definitely run large.  I ordered a M and L first to see which would fit best.  They were both too big so I returned those and bought a small.  I'm 5'5"", 158 lbs.  The small fit PERFECT until I washed them.  They shrunk a bit so now they fit in the waist but they are a tad too short.  :-(  They are wide legged all the way from waist to ankle so they are not super flattering.  But they are good for around the house, which is what I bought them for.  They are warm and soft inside.  They're starting to pill in the inner thighs where my legs rub together when I walk, even though I've only worn them about 5-10 times.  Overall will meet my needs."
3.0,To long The pants are very comfortable but too long and very wide . They are much bigger then expected
3.0,"A bit large My own fault for not reading full description, it doesn't have pockets. Also, a lot baggier/bigger than my normal fit. I mean, it'd be nice if it were just me loosing weight... alas, no. Just a large fit."
3.0,"A little tight at the size I usually order. I read the reviews before purchase, and they seemed to suggest that the size of these were ""on-target"" with one's usual size, but I think that must have been someone who likes to ""show off"" a little more of their assets than I do.  These lounge pants are a little tight in the lower trunk, especially if you're 73 and disinclined to ""show off"" anything.  (I mean, what's the point?  At 73 I tend to be invisible anyway.)  I use these as PJ bottoms, and I like loose fitting apparel when I sleep.  I've ordered two more pairs in a larger size and expect to be happier.  The workmanship seems to be quite good: seams stable, cut of the fabric appropriate to the use of the material, etc.  The fabric is lovely and soft, but I have yet to launder it yet, so I can't speak to how well it stands up to frequent washing.  Overall satisfied."
3.0,"Quality not what it used to be I've ordered these sweatpants many times, they are my go-to for comfy home lounging.  However, I've had to sew 2 separate holes (different spots).  Luckily they were just along the seam so an easy fix, but it bums me out that price has gone up and quality has gone down."
3.0,"Waaaay oversized The sizing on these is way off. I'm typically a size 14 in jeans. I got the 2x in these. I was torn on that decision, thinking an XL might work, but I decided  on the bigger size just in case (I use them mostly for sleeping in and some lounging around in, so a little big would be fine, but too small would be uncomfortable ). But the 2x turns out to be MUCH bigger than expected. Like they literally fall right off my body. I can't walk around in them like even to get up to get a drink without having to hold them up with my hands. And even held up and pulled up with my hands, the legs are too long. I have average length legs and am 5'6. And I walk all over the legs of these. I double checked to make sure that I hadn't mistakenly ordered a MEN'S 2x instead of a women's.(and I think they still might even be big for a men's) Nah. I ordered right. And the tag says 2x so I didn't just get shipped a big size by mistake. They really are huge. The fabric is nice. But the fit is nuts. Totally unwearably oversized."
3.0,Seems to be well made but has no pockets or draw string to help hold up the pants. Seems to be well made but has no pockets or draw string to tighten up the waist.
3.0,"No pockets OopsI messed up.I could not get petite ( I am 5 ft), but I thought I ordered pockets.My fault for looking at so many pants trying to find the right ones.The length is ok for me. I expect they may be short for those who expect a regular length.If your backside is normal or generously endowed, these may not be the pants for you as the backside  dips a bit on me.I am keeping the pants because overall the fit is better than most for me, but I surely will miss the pockets."
3.0,"Not quite right! After reading the reviews I was hesitant to purchase, but I only need these pants for yard work.  The fit is something like maternity pants‚Ä¶ higher in the front than back.  I am 5‚Äô3‚Äù / 155 lbs.  they are a little snug through hips and thighs but slightly loose in the waist.  For what I need them for they will be fine."
3.0,Too short for me I‚Äôm Too short in length. Too short wasted.
3.0,"Ok, size down ! I usually wear a Medium and that‚Äôs what I ordered. I purchased 4 pairs and wearing one now. Pant fits like a large. I would have been ok if they had a string but they don‚Äôt so I‚Äôm hoping it may shrink when I wash them. I‚Äôm am 5‚Äô7 and they are long enough but could be longer. Overall they are comfortable for the price.Update: I purchased 4 pairs. One was long enough but too big, I wore another pair and they were too short but ok at the waist. I‚Äôm over it üò° these are a hit and miss."
3.0,"Unraveled First time I wrote them the waistband began to unravel.  I cut the loose threads,  but the next time was even worse.  Almost completely unraveled! Really disappointing!"
3.0,"not very warm. thin material material is thin, not a warm pant"
3.0,Not created equal I ordered a pair of these in gray and loved them. The fit was perfect.So I ordered another pair in the same size in blue and they do not fit the same.
3.0,"Fits, but not the best quality Soft and comfortable, but loose in the waist. I can tell the waistband is already stretching out, and taking them in won't be easy. You can't just tack darts into sweatpants, because of the thickness of the fabric and the elastic waistband - the entire waistband would have to be taken off, the waist taken in, the waistband shortened or the elastic replaced, then the waistband would be sewn back back onto the pants.  Not worth the effort for such cheaply-made sweats.But, they ARE cheap, and you do get what you pay for. I use them for hanging around the house and as pajamas when it's really cold, and they can be replaced easily enough.Don't expect high-quality, durable clothes. Hanes has really gone down in quality in recent years, especially the women's lines."
3.0,"Large and Long Fit for 5‚Äô4‚Äù I bought an XL originally and it was falling off & I have hips and thighs that are noticeable. I generally like pants to be fairly loose, not tight, but whoa, this was large. So, since they‚Äôre just plain inexpensive, I ordered the L. They fit much better initially, but stretch out when wearing. They take normal shape after washing but again, balloon out when worn for awhile.The length, for me, is a touch long, probably because I don‚Äôt wear much of a heel.Lastly, this pant picks up every dog hair in the house and won‚Äôt let go. So, they are strictly for in and around house wear.In the end, because they‚Äôre cheap to buy I could buy another, but wouldn‚Äôt rush out. Meh"
3.0,"Runs Large! The material is warm, nice and cozy.  However, these sweats run very large and gets baggier when worn.  The first time I wore them, the print of my knees was embedded in the material the entire time.  The stretch did not bounce back when standing up.  This was not cool.  So, I wear them around the house to lounge around.  I do not wear them out."
3.0,Poor stitching These were great but after a few washes the sewing in the rear and waistband started to come out.
3.0,"Good fabric, weird fit I bought the sweatpants and the matching sweat shirt. The shirt is fine, but the pants had some problems for me. They were lower at the waist and bigger. They did not reach my waist, but were more like hip-huggers with very long legs. I think I could have worn them, but they shrunk quite a bit, so that they were very tight in the crotch, with an even lower waist. I'm 5' 5"", 125 pounds, and could not wear them comfortably. I'm donating them, but keeping the sweatshirt. Still looking for the perfect pair of sweatpants I used to be able to find, with an elastic waist that actually hits at my waist, and has pockets."
3.0,"Comfy but they run HUGE I bought the size I thought would fit best but they‚Äôre HUGE at the waist and the length is quite long, too. I would‚Äôve bought another pair one size down but they don‚Äôt have pockets. Never realized how much I need pockets until they weren‚Äôt there. Keeping them anyways for those lazy days."
3.0,"Watch what size you order! I normally wear an XL pant. I saw that it says they run large so I ordered a L. They still are too big!  They are way too long (I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7‚Äù so I‚Äôm not short) and they fall off my waist. Luckily I have hips/butt that keeps them from falling all the way down. Overall, they are nice and comfortable but they do run large."
3.0,Then when you wash them they shrink When my sister first put them on there were a little too long and then when they got washed they shrunk some so they really didn't fit her
3.0,too big around waist and length i will put these in the washer and dry them on real hot setting. these pants always shrink anyway.  so i am keeping them.  hope they will be alright then. i just put these on today. i am very shocked of the cheap fabric. i have not washed them yet.  the ones i bought years ago are much heavier for the winter months.  these pants are only good for the summer.  very thin fabric. i call the fabric 'recycled soda bottles'. because that's exactly what they are.  i would much rather pay more and get better quality like Hanes used to sell.  i don't expect these to last very long at all.
3.0,"Waist band is loose. The pants are just long enough to cover the ankle when standing, but when seated leave the entire ankle exposed. The waistband is the same diameter as the hips, so if your built that way, they would be great."
3.0,loved the material I ordered a medium and they run large. returned for a smaller size.
3.0,Loose Loose and a little baggy. It says low pill fabric but half a day of wear and it's already pilling a good amount on the thighs. Inside fabric is not too scratchy.
3.0,"Fit and quality Ordered this product in an XL, which ismt nirmal size. Although thet were nice and thick, they were waaaay to bug. Sent them back and irdered large. I got a product that was too small and the fabric was far thinner. Dont order clothes from Amazon!!!!!"
3.0,"Material is good, but I received the wrong size. The material is good, but I received the wrong size. I order XXl for my daughter, but I received 2XL. My daughter is between sizes, L/XL, but she likes her pants a little loose, so I always order a size up for her. This pair of pants is extremely huge on her, She definitely can't wear it. Total waste of money, as I hate returning things. I am going to order it again, hoping they send me the correct size; fingers crossed."
3.0,"Good for the price These are medium weight fabric. Fairly durable, but they do get a little pilly. I‚Äôm hard on them and replace every couple of years.I‚Äôm 5‚Äô 4‚Äù, 135-139 lbs. and wear a size 6 in regular jeans, size 4 in high end jeans.In other brands I would wear a medium, but go with a small in these. They‚Äôre a little loose in the waist, but comfy that way. Also loose in the butt and legs.The petite is a bit short on me (sits just at the tops of my shoes). The regular bunches a little at the tops of my shoes, but I prefer a little bunching over too short.I don‚Äôt put them in the dryer, so I can‚Äôt comment on shrinkage."
3.0,"Scratchy fleece I needed really loose sweatpants following my knee replacement surgery so while these met that criteria, the material was scratchy and uncomfortable against my knee. Perhaps a few more times of washing them will help."
3.0,"HUMONGOUS As other reviewers stated, these sweatpants seem to run large. The waistband of my small is 31"", which is what the manufacturer calls medium, or just a tad narrower than the widest part of my hips. I was looking for really basic sweatpants, without pockets or a drawstring, to wear as pajama pants. The price is certainly right, and the fabric is toasty. Given all that, I'm going to try shrinking them rather than returning."
3.0,"Loose & comfy but has major pilling Not that satisfied but hey I paid $7.50 for them so they'll do. Read below for details. PROS‚Äê loose fitting- really warm- comfy- great lounge at home pants CONS- a little too baggy in crotch area- pant length runs a little short- no drawstring so u can't adjust waist- major pilling in crotch area after 1st wash (I hadn't even worn them, only tried them on)Last one is why I gave this a 3 star.I'm 5'4 and 214 lbs. I purchased both Large & XL at same time. Large was the better match."
3.0,"Not as advertised The length was not 29 as advertised, but 31.  And they flared way out at the bottoms.  I was able to remodel them by taking in the side seems to make straight legs, and by cutting off the bottoms and stitching a new hem.  The color was right, the waist was right, the material was right, and the price was right, so I took a chance.  I am glad my remodel worked and they look nice now."
3.0,Don‚Äôt expect too much from these These are good for lounging around the house. I washed them in cool water medium dry and they shrunk especially in the length. Fabric is thin. But again I only bought these for house cleaning so I guess it‚Äôs ok. I would not wear these out anywhere.
3.0,"Would be better with Pockets They are comfortable,  I just wish they had pockets."
3.0,"Loose fit, attracts cat hair The pants are a bit too loose, I ordered a small.  The pants attract every single cat hair in my house, I look as fluffy as my cats. Not the look I was going for."
3.0,"quality material but size down! Ordering down always makes me anxious. I'd rather things be a little too big than too small. Listen to the comments and order down. I'm a size 12ish and ordered the large. way. too. big. They are falling off my hips. I can't keep them up because the waistband is not tight enough. Otherwise, the material of these sweatpants is so great. They are a classic fleece on the inside like you remember from long ago. And they are nice and thick. I didn't find they shrunk much in the hot dryer (to my disappointment). It's a shame the waistband is off."
3.0,"They stretch out.  Order smaller size. These are comfortable,  but the sizes do run big.  I wish I would have ordered 2 sizes smaller.  They fit ok when you first put them on,  but they stretch as the day goes on.  They're way too baggy after about an hour of wear.  I do really like them and will order more,  but it will be smaller sizes.  They're great for lounging or throw on a button down or tshirt and you could wear them to run errands."
3.0,"Run very big These pants are a very soft and comfortable material, but the fit is too loose. I bought a size small, and the length of the pants is a bit long for me and the waist is about 3 sizes too big. I am disappointed in the sizing even though they are comfortable."
3.0,"softest sweatpants While these are the softest sweatpants, the width of the bell bottoms make me feel like I'm back in the '70's again."
3.0,"heavier sweatshirt type fabric, runs large If you want warm cozy sweatpants, these would be fine.  However, for southern climes it was too warm for my needs.  They do run really large, so be aware."
3.0,"2 sizes to big I am a standard size 22 or 22/24 (2Xl) in sweat pants. I bought the XXL and there is at least 6-7 inches that I can pull out to the front without even stretching the pants. There is so tie so no way to tighten them. I love things loose and comfy but without me physically holding them up they fall down to my ankles and I carry my weight in my butt and thighs. Also this is AFTER I washed and dried them in med heat. Order at least a size down, maybe 2 sizes if you are in between a size. Otherwise great, comfy, super cheap price."
3.0,"Not the same Hanes sweatpants as before Amazon said these were the pants I had ordered before, but they're not. These must be what Hanes is making now and has replaced their basic sweatpants with these. Before they were all cotton, these are not. I like my sweatpants a little large so I buy a size up. Then they shrink a little in the wash and are a perfect length. These do not shrink and so they stay really long. If you are taller than I am (5'3"") this may be just perfect for you. Other than that, they're ok. But why did they have to go and change something perfectly good???"
3.0,"Weird sizing I just bought these to wear over my pants when I take my dogs out in the winter so I‚Äôm not so cold, and they serve that purpose just fine. But I had to cut about six inches of length off and hem them before I could wear them."
3.0,"Clear Packaging The most annoying thing was the clear packaging. I mean, who uses that? Especially during Christmas. It was intended to be a surprise with an entire outfit, but that was ruined because the packaging was see through. My mom is 4""11 so I bought her the small. They are baggy and she had to hem them, which was also frustrating. She does like them otherwise."
3.0,"AMAZON made a mistake in my order. I got these pants but I did order the cuffed, W/pockets and drawstring sweat pants.  I don't like the cuffed because my legs swell  and also .  They run very large,  I am keeping them because I already am wearing them.  I wanted the open bottom sweatpants."
3.0,"Is this a Men's size??? This shows it's a Medium but it is NOT the same Medium size I purchased a few months back.  This one has GOT to be a Men's Medium, not a Women's.  WAY too big in the waist!"
3.0,"How I alter them I‚Äôve ordered these before so I knew what to expect.  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô1 and 98 lbs. soaking wet so even the xtra small is too large and too long.  After washing,  I remove the waist band, take in the sides and shorten to correct length.  Then I fashion a pocket out of the fabric I cut off length and attach and reattach the waist band.  Because, my cell phone goes wherever I go.I‚Äôve been wearing the ones I ordered previously for 3-1/2 years, so it‚Äôs worth it at this price."
3.0,"These pants on me 5‚Äô2 115lbs look I‚Äôm not wearing them out anywhere. Too bulky lookingHousework, pj bottoms their warm and cozy perfect for this cold NY weather. I bought 3 pairs and happy I did at that price I‚Äôm all set to stay at home"
3.0,"Comfy. These are a bit thin and run large. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3 1/2 and 153 lbs, carry most weight in the middle and ordered M. They were big on me but the length and waist were fine. Weird fit on my body at least but great for lounging around the house or sleep. And for the price I have no regrets with my purchase."
3.0,"not what I was expecting Having purchased Hanes sweats before I wasn't expecting these to be any different but they were. First they are much larger. The waist and length are several inches larger than the ones I already have. Second, the fabric is not at all likeable. They feel like cheap polyester and very stiff. Also they are fleece lined and that isn't stated in the description Amazon has. I had to read the actual description from Hanes to realize they had a fleece lining. I would never had ordered them had I known. So if your looking for fleece lined sweatpants that run VERY big and like them a bit stiff, then these are for you. Otherwise keep looking."
3.0,"Doesn't have drawstring waist as advertised. Weight fine, a bit long but really needed drawstring to adjust waist."
3.0,"Pill Up Quickly These are definitely NOT 5 star pants, but I'd have given them at least 4 stars expect for these two reasons:1. They pill up very quickly, especially between the legs (yes, I'm chubby-bubby and my upper thighs rub, but really well-made pants won't pill up so quickly!)2. There was no tag on them whatsoever, so how do I know these pants are not ""gently used"" in lieu of unworn, brand new pants?Other than that, they are comfortable albeit not all that flattering. I probably (most likely) won't order another pair."
3.0,Too big !! Please listen when everyone is saying they are too big !! Order a size down or even 2
3.0,"Large more like an XL Am so bummed.  The size chart for these pants does not reflect actual size, at least for my size - large.  I am consistently a large.  I was hoping to stock up for winter comfort.  All three ordered were way too large.  The legs are even way too wide.  They looked like sacks."
3.0,Fine They are okay to wear around the house... the seams pull apart around the waist and they pick up lint pretty bad.
3.0,Thin These are just ok.  Kind of thinner than I would have liked.  Loose fitting but a large would've been too small so went with XL.
3.0,"Sent me a men‚Äôs small. Not a women‚Äôs. Got these for my daughter, they sent a men‚Äôs small. It‚Äôs huge on her. Guess they need to mark it better for the person sending them out.As for the pants themselves, they‚Äôre comfy. Decent fabric. But will be returning them, I hope the others I ordered aren‚Äôt also men‚Äôs small.Update: yuuup. They‚Äôre all a men‚Äôs small/ women‚Äôs medium. I said to heck with it and I‚Äôm rockin some hot pink and purple sweats! ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
3.0,"HUGE! Great, super soft comfy pants, but the sizes are wayyy off. I am usually a Large or XL, and so I ordered a large. When I got them, the waist band was large enough to accommodate someone at least twice my size or bigger. Ordered a Small and they fit perfect, but I am certainly not a ""small"" person. That being said, these pants are great for people with large hips, thick thighs and large bums like me, but if you have a smaller frame, these pants will not fit you."
3.0,"BIG COMFY These are hilariously large.  I usually wear a size 2 or 4, and I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3‚Äù.  I ordered the size small petite, and the legs are soooo long that I have to roll the waist and the pants still drag on the floor.  But they are still comfy, so I‚Äôm officially dubbing them ‚Äúmy quarantine pants‚Äù and I don‚Äôt even care if I look like a ten year old trying to wear her mom‚Äôs clothes.  The comically baggy pants will only be a problem if I have to run from zombies, but that‚Äôs even less likely than everything else that‚Äôs been going on, right?Seriously, though, if you are actually petite and not borderline like me, you might have trouble walking in these. ;)"
3.0,"These are HUGE - Buyer Beware!! These are huge.  I am 5'3, 145lbs, and I usually wear a size 8/10 in jeans.  I ordered a size large, and they are HUGE.  I was going to return them, but decided my husband could wear them around the house (they are just straight leg sweat pants, big deal)... so I washed them in hot water and they did shrink, but they are still really big.  I am going to re-order a size small for myself and hope they fit after washing in hot.  Buyer beware.  These things are VERY over-sized."
3.0,This item is noted as TRUE FIT! ...NOT TRUE! The reviews of how well the item fit says to purchase your usual size.....I purchased this very same item from other sellers who noted it as TOO LARGE AND BUY A SIZE SMALLER in different colors. Well... I thought due to the reviews of this item...it maybe due to the colors. WELL...I purchased a size large...(I ware a size 12) and the pants are almost falling off! I am tired of sending things back! I am tacking the things up to ware  around the house!
3.0,they don't wash up as nicely as Champion sweat pants and not as heavy either. Came out of wash wrinkled.  didn't fit
3.0,"LIghtweight, loose , long I am 5 ft 8 or 9, and the size medium came right down to ankles, great for me, shorter women will find them too long  These are more like a lightweight French terry, so for really cold days they will not be very warm unless a thermal layer is added underneath.  The reason it only got 3 stars.... they are very loose and have a frumpy fit. The picture shows a straight leg sweatpant and these are bootcut with a flare at ankle..  I read reviews... these run big, I wear a size 12 or large, and a medium was too big. The waistband doesnt have enough elastic, I wore these to do fall yardwork and was constantly pulling my pants up. These would be great for inhouse lounging or pjs, which is what I will use them for in future."
3.0,"Get what you pay for! These pants are a thin fleece. Way too long! I'm 5""5. Fit is okay. Price was good but quality is poor. I don't recommend these pants! You get what you payfor!"
3.0,Runs large I ordered an extra large in these but they are really big. I got an ex large in the top and it fits. These pants I have to pull up really high and then roll down.  I would of sent them back but I washed them as soon as they came in.
3.0,Fit wrong Waist is too short in the back otherwise they‚Äôre nice pants but I won‚Äôt buy them again
3.0,"WAY too big!  But perfect if you ordered the right size Price was great ($8 after featured on yahoo news) but medium is way too big (pajama now).  Would have given a four for bad sizing advice but I am giving three for the fact that I have to order a small again and the price went up.  Will review the small size after I lounge around today.Update:  size small works out perfectly so I ended up bought two.  Comfortable, not flattering (for $11 what do you expect?) but perfectly fine for running errands or for traveling."
3.0,Wrong size I like Hanes sweatshirts over all. I ordered a petite medium but received a regular medium. I didn‚Äôt want to bother to send it back since I am wearing it inside home‚òπÔ∏è
3.0,"Great color, but thin fabric I bought these because the description said these were thick and warm. These are not thick at all ‚Äî the fabric is thin. While these are cute and comfy (so I‚Äôm keeping them), they are not warm enough for winter wear."
3.0,"Inaccurate sizing I ordered these pants in two different colors but the same size. One guy around my waist just fine, but the other was way too small. Both were very long and wide leg when described as straight leg. The material was much thinner than I had hoped."
3.0,"Runs Large - Very comfy. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2‚Äù and weigh 129. I read that this product runs large so I purchased the Small size. These are still fairly loose in the waist and were definitely longer than 31 inches and the inseam‚ÄîI had to roll them up so I wouldn‚Äôt trip over them. However, after one wash, they did shrink some. The legs are very roomy.  These are not the cool Hanes sweats of the 90s, that is for sure.  Overall, not a bad purchase for $11 since I‚Äôm just going to kick around the house in them."
3.0,"You get what you pay for! First of all, it‚Äôs not open bottom pants, which I don‚Äôt like; and that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm sending it back!!! And secondly, the are huge!!! So, you need to order 2 size smaller than you actually wear! And a last: it‚Äôs not that thick as it subscribed , like normal sweatpants would be!"
3.0,"Wayyyyy to Big Omg these sweatpants are huuuuge. I am 5‚Äô6 and they are still so long. I had them pulled up high but the waist is loose so they kept falling down. I ordered a medium. I usually get large sizes in sweatpants since I have a big bottom and dont want the pants to be tight but this medium feels like an extra large on me. I like the material. Its soft, comfy and warm. I wish I had gotten a smaller size to fit me better. For the price they are good, just go way down in size."
3.0,"Very long I am a bit short, but I can usually just pull sweatpants up a little to get a good fit. These are quite long, but otherwise fit as expected."
3.0,"Nice pants but material is strange I bought this item due to the overwhelming reviews (over 6,000) and 4 star rating.  I ordered 3 of these and I am returning 2 (I opened and wore one pair).  They are not bad sweatpants - - the overall fit is good (I bought the XL size , I am 5'3 and about 185).  The pro's are that these pants appear that they will wear  well, will not shrink and have a good price point.  The cons are that they are very thick and the fabric is not particularly soft.  The reason I am returning is due to the material  - which is some kind of cotton polyster blend.  Only rated as 3 star."
3.0,"Way too big I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3‚Äù and normally wear a size 12.  Amazon told me an XL would fit me best, so that‚Äôs what I ordered.  The waist is about 2‚Äù too big, and there is no elastic or drawstrings to make them fit better."
3.0,Runs big These run big - they are soft and warm but they pill after washing
3.0,Pills very easily Pants are a tad too long but I can deal with that but they are pulling after only the third wear. Won‚Äôt last too long i suspect
3.0,"Ordered a size down, should‚Äôve ordered even smaller These are HUGE. I think there must be some mistake and they sent men‚Äôs sizes instead because I ordered the Small and it fits like a large! I even sized down!!! My advice: size down at least two sizes, but if you‚Äôre smaller than me, 5‚Äô5‚Äù around 130lbs, don‚Äôt bother because they won‚Äôt fit. I‚Äôm going to try a hot water wash because I hate returning things and since it was so cheap I can just hem them if I still need to. They are soft and cozy, so I‚Äôm giving them a couple stars anyway."
3.0,So comfy! I love love these. Think a loose fitting yoga pant. So comfy I may buy another pair. Yes order 1 size down. I am a large (size 10-12) and I ordered Medium and they fit perfectly. They are a little long but that‚Äôs better than too short. Definitely order a pair.Update: Ordered my second pair. Same size M (one size down from normal size) but this pair seems extra big in the waist. They slide down constantly. But the tag says M. The sizing is definitely off with these pants.
3.0,"Small waist, small butt, huge legs and made for someone 5‚Äô9‚Äù tall Waist snug, pants fit good through butt and that‚Äôs great because I don‚Äôt have much of a butt, legs below butt are 3-5 inches too large (3 top and gradually going to 5 inches at bottom, length was very long like 5 inches need to be cut off. I weigh 160 and am 5‚Äô2‚Äù and usually wear a size 10.  I have muscular legs so if your legs are large, you are 5‚Äô9‚Äù, you have a small butt and waist, these pants are for you. Because the price was great and they have a soft pile lining I will shorted and take the pants in rather than sending them back."
3.0,Loose it‚Äôs big on the waist and it‚Äôs very long
3.0,"Dependable but Not my Favorite Pair Hanes is pretty dependable as a rule, and I have a few other pairs.  I bought a large because I really only wanted to sleep in them.  They are not the most comfortable sweats I've had and not really the most attractive to wear outdoors (perhaps if I got the right size?).  Unfortunately, they came with a small hole in them near a seam, which I guess I can repair.  They certainly were a bargain for the money."
3.0,"Not Petite I ordere two petite pants for my mom.  The pants are nice, but the length is to long and now I have to take out my sewing machine to hem the pants.  Very disappointed."
3.0,"Two sizes too big I'm happy with the quality of the material and construction of these lounge pants, but I ordered a medium and they look like an XL in person. Washed them and they are still at least a large or better. But Amazon, as usual, has impeccable customer service on returns...so it's still a positive experience overall. Just beware on ordering...size down a bit."
3.0,I thought I ordered petite small (5‚Äô2‚Äù-102 lbs) I got plus size petite!! Way toooo big
3.0,"Larger than expected The waist was fine but the legs were enormous. (I wear s/m.) Very wide, and very long. There‚Äôs a lot of butt and crotch room, too. I‚Äôm not bothered by it because they‚Äôre for lounging around the house. But I would look frumpy if I wore them out of the house. Haha. I will say that they‚Äôre very comfy."
3.0,I should have ordered a larger size They aren't true to size
3.0,I wouldn't purchase again The pant fits fine through the hip but is way longer than described. It said a 30 inch inseam and it more like 32 maybe 34. I have a small waist compared to my hips so I wish it had a drawstring waist. I do like the color and material.
3.0,"Fit was off for me. I usually wear a medium in casual wear pants.  These are a about 3"" too long on me, but I also am just 5""2"". I should have ordered the medium. I will keep these as they are comfortable, but in the future will order the small. I have a large behind and thighs and thought the medium would work, but these at least for me were too big.  Thank you! Hope this helps!"
3.0,not it i'm 5'0 and weigh 130lbs and sadly this did not fit me at all by the waist i even picked a size smaller than often but the material was so soft
3.0,"No drawstring, fall down! These pants are super cozy and thick, but there is no drawstring... just an elastic band that is not very stretchy. They keep falling down, even though they are comfortable in the waist. They do not have pockets either, which is fine for lounging around the house. I will return because I can‚Äôt keep them up! EDIT: I purchased a smaller size and they are pretty great! I wish the elastic was tighter, they are stretching a lot already. Warning, they will shrink aggressively in the wash too."
3.0,"Fit is big I am a size 12, 5‚Äô6 woman. I ordered a large. The overall fit is good, baggy but not huge but the waist is sloppy like it is meant for hip level, it doesn‚Äôt taper in at all. There is no string in the waist to cinch in the fit and keep them up. I cut a small hole in the inside of the front of the waistband and threaded a tennis shoe shoestring through it. This solved the sagging issue for me.  I can keep the pants at my natural waist and now the fit is lose but very comfortable without sag. Not sure that the hole I threaded the string through won‚Äôt grow as the knit of the waist band is loose. I washed on warm and dried on low with no shrinking. Length is almost on the floor when barefoot. Medium to light weight material. Overall I prefer the Gildan pair I ordered at the same time in size XL."
3.0,"I ordered one size smaller than usual; it was still too large I am still deciding whether to alter this to fit or to return it.  It is good quality, just too big. Sizing runs very large."
3.0,"Larger than expected The sweat pants in size M were larger than expected at waist and in length. They shrank a little after the first wash, and I hope will shrink a little more with the next wash."
3.0,"I ordered a size small, NOT PETITE Color very nice‚Ä¶heather blueMaterial warm enough to brave the snowI‚Äôm 5ft 4 in, weigh 123Length is fine but too tight in the waistIf I could get a small instead of petite, I would order another pair"
3.0,"Words can‚Äôt describe how large the S/P/Ch is But I‚Äôm going to try anyway. I held them up, disappearing from view behind them, and the comment I got was, ‚ÄúWell check the tag to see what size you got.‚Äù If you‚Äôre size 4-6, shop elsewhere or wear them over your jeans, they are that big and no drawstring. They are cotton poly blend so there is no amount of high heat drying that will solve this. A bit thin but soft material. Great buy for the price. Rub them longingly as you pack them into a bag to return them."
3.0,"Nice, but material is thin if looking for warmth. Nice looking and feel good, but not a heavy material for warmth. Need to to taper a bit more as the legs are wide from the knee down. Great for a relaxing fit inside."
3.0,"Fit is too big I wear a large bottom and these were too big all the way around. These feel fantastic - smooth and a nice weight. But the length is too long (I am only 5'3"") but the waist, which I do normally wear a large, was very lose. Hips, thighs, etc. were all loose.I will try to find a pair that comes in petite. If you are petite, and can sew, these might be good for you. You might want to size down too."
3.0,"Strange fit I bought these for my tweenager. I got a small thinking they would fit like a girls XXL, but they are too wide. Also the rise in the front is higher and if you have junk in the trunk, they will be too low in the back for you. That was my daughters problem. I guess the pants aren't terrible, they're just not for anyone with curves. The thickness of the pants was fine, however. I bought 4 colors, but ended up returning them all. That was a great price though."
3.0,"Not good quality but comfortable These are nice, warm and comfortable. I could lounge in them all day. But I was in for a nasty surprise when I washed them! The cloth isn‚Äôt really good quality. Only one wash and there were fuzz balls all over them. I defuzzed them but after washing them and defusing multiple times, eventually the fuzz balls were back. So there goes one star!And NO pockets! That takes away another star"
3.0,"Runs large I am typically a size 4 with long legs and got the small. They are pretty big, like, I really need a belt to wear these. The length is just right though finally. They're very warm and comfy but not remotely attractive, especially being so large."
3.0,Runs large Bought pants according to height and weight. They are still too large.. I‚Äôll keep them and wear a long shirt over them. Order a size smaller if you are slim..
3.0,Very large pant I believe these pants are for much larger folks. The only reason I have them now is because I wore them. But wearing them with something else beneath because they are huge pants. They almost fall off even with something underneath. So the size seems larger than advertised.
3.0,"Too large I bought this for my mon an they were Way too large, order one size less."
3.0,Runs very large I should be at the low end of the XL but I ordered a Large because everyone says they runs large. Well they run extremely large as even the Large was way to big. My advise is that if you are on the low end of one size range then go two sizes down.Besides that they feel great so I may order some more in medium. At least now I can say I fit in mediums again. :)
3.0,"Comfortable, btu probably a better fit on someone without curves These do run large as stated in the description and they are also very long, and wide. I feel like a am back in the 70's with extra wide bellbottoms when I put them on.  I think the fit would be better for a tall straight built person since there is no drawstring to adjust the gap at my back.  Otherwise, they are nicely made and comfortable for wearing around the house."
3.0,"Not sure how I feel They‚Äôre nice pants, but they‚Äôre too long and way too loose :("
3.0,"sizing had to take waist up 4"" and the crotch length is too short.  feel like they are going to fall off.  I will keep them, but will not order more."
3.0,"Good for the price These pants are a thinner material..no pockets..loose fit..I am 5'4"" 145 lbs...waist is a comfortable fit not tight..length is very long on me..at least 30"" inseam..I rolled them up and they are comfortable for lounging..havent washed them yet but they seem to be okay  for the price"
3.0,Long! Very long! I am only 5'3' so I am accustomed to pants being too long but these were more than expected. If they would have cost more than I would have returned them but for sweats to wear around the house on cold days then I just roll them up until they fall and then walk on them. I would not buy again thought.  Color is as expected and they are comfortable and soft. Just don't buy if you are concerned with length.
3.0,üëçüèª üëçüèª
3.0,No drawstring at waist/no pockets Overall I like the material of these pants...but they did run a little large and stretch out during the day so without a drawstring they just look saggy and sloppy. I also wish they had pockets
3.0,"Go down a size! I have bought five pairs of these in the past year, at three different times. They are definitely oversized. I ordered more because I initially bought my true size, a medium, and got tired of them falling down and yanking up the waist all the time and bought smalls. I am five feet five inches, 147 lbs, about a 10 in pants, and I have not worn a small in pants in decades. But I am in these pants. And they are still a little big in the waist. I also have to wear the petite. The small regular is 3 inches too long and the legs are also too wide. So the sizing is totally weird, and they pill quickly in the inner thigh. But the price is good."
3.0,not all fit that are the same size i bought 3 pairs of these pants in different color and they all fit differently.  one pair of med fit just right.  the other pair of med are a little tight and the last pair i got in med are to big.  so i guess its a roll of the dice if they all fit just right.  i wont be buying this brand again
3.0,"RUN TOO SHORT IN BACK RISE I am 5'8"" and ordered size Large, per the online size chart.  The fabric is as expected, for fleece sweats in this price range.  I had to return this due to the short back rise.  The rise was a bit high in the front, but would not come up to natural waist level in the back.  I carry weight in the belly, but have a bit of a flat butt, so this rise issue was confusing to me."
3.0,Ran very large These pants ran very large. I usually take a medium and they are falling off of me. I am going to have to shorten them and take them in. Silly me bought four pairs before I knew if  I liked them
3.0,"Fits a bit big -- my 3rd pair -- all 3 are a little different too I wear a 20-22W so should get a 1X not a 2X? -- which is what I bought.  I have 3 colors (purple, turquoise and Pink)‚Ä¶  and love the beautiful colors!! I match with knit tunic tops to wear in the winter at home.  For that purpose they are just fine.CONS -- no draw string at the waistCONS -- the ankle finish and fit may vary a bit between pairs, one I got was petite, another regular length -- no rhyme or reason to how they are selecting the pairs to shipPROS -- really a good value and soft and cozy fabric, roomy fit on me"
3.0,"Disappointed Disappointed they didn't fit. Well made, but they run large."
3.0,"Waist stretched out I purchased three pair of these for my elderly mom. Two of them are great and have washed and worn beautifully. The third pair for some reason stretched out at the waist after the first wash and can‚Äôt be worn as they don‚Äôt stay up. I would like to order more, but don‚Äôt want to take a chance the elastic waist will be defective."
3.0,"Way to big ! I buy Hanes brand a lot but for some reason these pants are super big, more like an extra large."
3.0,"Waist is too big! The waist is too big! It‚Äôs like they were made to have a drawstring waist, but the manufacturer forgot to make it that way. Otherwise the fit is good. I could not order a size smaller because then the hips and thighs would be too tight. And I am not a small waisted person. Fabric feels good. But I will be sewing darts in the waistband. But, hey, I only paid $7.50!"
3.0,"The petite length isn't petite. I ordered petite length. I did not get petite length. The price of the pants doesn't warrant them being tailored. Who tailors sweatpants?  It also doesn't warrant a return, too much of a hassle. I guess just roll them up; if your under 5 ft 5. Next time just try and find them in a store.  Cuffs on sweatpants is always an  interesting look. If your short you know all too well. The fit is fine. My problem was with leg length."
3.0,"Waist too big and pants too short I saw the reviews but foolishly purchased them anyway. If I roll the waist down, they'll be good enough for lazing around. And they were inexpensive. But small was the smallest size and I'm swimming in them. oh - and they border on being too short.  Btw I'm 5' 5"" and 115 lbs. These would be great if you're 5' 4"" and 130 lbs."
3.0,"At least a size too large These mediums are bigger than the large size Hanes from a couple of years ago. They might work better for someone with a larger stomach and a shorter rise and torso. On me, the waist bags down low below my stomach. I am able to wear them, they are just look a little odd. The length is pretty good for my height 5'8. I hope they do not shrink in length. They are soft, but still losing fuzzies after being washed."
3.0,"If only my waist was larger than my hips, these might fit I bought three of these pants and went for a loose fit but there is no way they can fit me since the waist is larger than the hips. I used the size chart, once again, aiming for a loose fit (because I wanted to pull these pants over my shorts. sweats, or leggings when I go out to feed my horses). I'm still going to use them for that purpose but it's only because I'm not in a position to mail them back at this time, because of the pandemic."
3.0,very long These are supposed to be petite but they are a good 8 inches to long.  I am 5.4 and have another pair i bought a year ago.  Sad buyer beware
3.0,"washing them shrinks the leg length but not the waist The waist is a mid-rise, and a little loose. The legs were really wide so I washed them and put them in a dryer on medium heat. The waist did not shrink, but the length certainly did. They now are above my ankles. The rise is below my hips. I ordered a small and am 5'6"" and 120 pounds if that helps anyone. I wouldn't order them again. They weren't at the quality and fit of my other Hanes pants."
3.0,"Length were always asking about right to size on waist line but not Length am only 5""3 I like the thickness of the elastic around the waist line except that the length is long"
3.0,Do not like them Material is very thin. Will not order any other colors.
3.0,Runs Large I got the XL based on amazons suggested size and they are way too big. No strings so I can‚Äôt tighten. Tried to wash them in hopes they would shrink but no luck and now I can‚Äôt return.
3.0,Just for lounging I just wanted these for lounging around however the fit was extremely loose so I returned them.
3.0,"You get what you pay for. They are warm and comfortable. But, I have only had then for two weeks and the material on the inner thighs are already wearing out and pilling. Also there is already a hole in the crotch area. They are good pants if you wear them maybe once or twice a year and just sit in them, but any physical activity (like walking because that's the only ""exercise"" I have done in these) will wear them out very fast. Very disappointed."
3.0,"small ,petitte ??? I swim in this petite,small size. It's not what I receive last year,while ordering the very same size.Petite/ Small in US it's usually for a tiny person not with length of 29"""
3.0,Too big The sweats feel good inside and out. They do not run true to size. They are very long with huge legs. I have bought other Hanes shorts we‚Äôre the waist and legs are true to size. Very disappointed in this purchase.
3.0,"Waist stretches out quickly This line of sweats is one of those ‚Äòyou get what you pay for‚Äô things. The waist elastic quickly stretches out so you have to keep tugging your pants up. Both the pants and sweatshirt pill quickly. I got three sets and since I only want them for around the house, these cons are bearable. Thank goodness they are inexpensive!"
3.0,"Hanes swearpants These pants were ordered to just pull on early morning to take puppy outside.  I normally like a large, however, these are still too loose after 2 washings and dried in dryer.  I'm 5'5"" and they drag on the floor and are very wide at ankle, almost like bell bottoms.  Waist, has elastic, but unstretched, it's as big as the upper hips, therefore too loose."
3.0,"Too large and not as pictured I ordered 3 different colors because of the price but going to be returning them all. I am 5'6"" and about 120 lbs. I ordered a small and they were huge at the waist. I wish I could order a smaller size because I do like the length and they seem like they'd be comfortable. 2 out of 3 were as pictured but the black pair I ordered were tapered at the ankle instead of loose fit."
3.0,Not for large women Comfortable material; roomy legs but tight across the backside and hips.
3.0,large waist The body fit good but the waist was to big I had to take a tuck.  I would have really liked longer inseam
3.0,The more you wear them the bigger they get. Use for Exercise
3.0,"I am very dissatisfied with the Hanes Women‚Äôs EcoSmart Sweatpants What I liked is the fit around the waist, the fit perfectly..I very much disliked the legs very loose in the legs as well as the bottoms are way to big.. I am very dissatisfied with the Hanes eco  pants.. I bought 4 pair because they were a Hanes product and the price was great @ $7.50 each..Now I have 4 pair just sitting in the bedroom and reminds me how dumb I was to purchase all these pants for winter.."
3.0,"Run long and large I was surprised how long these pants ran and overall they run big.  I am between a medium and large and ordered a large, but these are more like an extra large.  Additionally they have lots of excess fleece balls inside and find them all over the house.  I gave them a good washing and drying and that helped, but think it will take many washings to eliminate them.  Overall they are just ok."
3.0,"Fits Perfectly Except for the Length Fits perfectly except for the length -- petite sizes were not offered. Asked for winterweight, but these pants are not what I define as winterweight, they are too thin for winter wear!"
3.0,I ordered petite but they are underneath my feet. Ordered petite but they are so long I have to roll the waistline. They also look bigger than the picture.
3.0,"Stick to your regular size. I ordered a size up to wear over biking shorts. They were way too big in the waist; I should have stuck to my regular size if Medium. I'm 5'4"" and 150lbs. The leg openings are bell bottoms- not what was depicted in the picture. I ended up donating them."
3.0,"No draw string! I love the color, they‚Äôre very soft, definitely run bigger than I expected and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever bought sweats before that didn‚Äôt have a drawstring if they didn‚Äôt have an elastic waist."
3.0,"Great, if you don't wash them... They do run big and they shrink when you wash them, so if the length was just right when you got them they will lose about2 to 3 inches in length when you wash them. That being said, they are so soft and comfortable. And warm and cozy on those cold nights. They did shrink but I now use them for lounging around the house so its still good."
3.0,No pockets Comfortable but no pockets or drawstring so make sure you know your size otherwise it may not be too tight or not comfortable enough. I just received mine and tried it...a bit on the long side but that's okay. But the waist is a bit loose so I am going to put a drawstring through. AND THERE IS NO POCKET. I think this has to do with this being a woman's sweatpants. We shouldn't need pockets (!)
3.0,"It stated order normal size, they are very baggy They are warm and comfortable, but it states to order your normal size. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5‚Äù and weigh 170, I ordered a large which is 12-14. I normally wear size 12 pants. I knew I should have ordered a medium."
3.0,"Disappointed.., Have the same brand and style in sweatshirts; so, decided to buy the sweatpants.  Find them to be poorly made, way too wide in the leg, very large.  Washed them and put them in a hot dryer to shrink them a bit.  It helped but seriously can‚Äôt recommend them."
3.0,Length not right I ordered a pair in Ebony and one in Navy Heather. The Navy Heather did have a label that said Eco Smart and they fit perfectly. The Ebony pair had a different label and were too short and a little smaller in the waist. I requested a return and replacement and the replacement came and it's the exact same pair! So it's still too short and smaller in the waist. I won't purchase these again.
3.0,"Great ladies sweatpants, runs a bit large I was looking for something to wear around the house on the weekends and to do light housework in, these fit the bill. I ordered a medium and hoped that they weren't too big like the other reviewers reported, but they do run large and I could have probably gone with a small. the length worked for me, the large part is in the bum and waist area. I will keep these and hope that I can get them to shrink up a bit in the dryer."
3.0,"Order 2 sizes down These sweatpants are enormous. I sent back 2 sizes until I finally got the one that fit me best. Even with that, the pants are long (I'm 5'8"") and the opening around the ankles is very wide. I kept them because I just didn't have the energy to send them back again. They do fit from the knees to the waist, but not from the knees to the feet!"
3.0,Great but... they are too loose. They constantly fall down. Not good when you work in the public eye to have your pants around your ankles :)) I even pulled them up to my chest. The length is great for taller ladies. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9 and they still were below my ankles after I pulled them up to my chest.  Order a size down. Thank me later.
3.0,"Waistband runs BIG They‚Äôre great quality and fairly thick however the pants are a complete straight fit. The waist had no retraction to it, I have to use a hair tie to keep them up."
3.0,Product description inconsistent- said regular but was petite. This was a gift. Again misleading in the ordering and description of product being sold. Then delivery had two different sizes depending on color.
3.0,"Significant Shrinkage These arrived seeming slightly larger than expected, but then after washing shrunk significantly.  They still fit but have shrunk from just touching my shoe to being just above my ankle when standing."
3.0,Too large I haven't seen them in person. Ordered and sent to my Mom. She said she couldn't wear them because they are way too big and long
3.0,"Shrank after 1st wash. Loved the color, the softness of the fabric and the fit. As this is sweat shirt fabic, I took care to wash on delicate cycle and dry on low heat, minimal time and yet, one pant leg shrank too short.  Had to cut and hem shorter."
3.0,Meh It fits but if you‚Äôre expecting the usual Hanes quality you‚Äôre in for a disappointment. The fabric seems to have a lower thread count. It‚Äôs not soft and it‚Äôs a magnet for hair and lint. They got me through the winter but I‚Äôll be shopping for new ones in autumn. They also have no pockets.
3.0,"Slate Heather small pairs fit perfectly below the waist.  Light steel small pairs 3"" wider waist! Hoping that the  light steel pairs would fit just like the pairs of slate heather I already had which fit perfectly just below the waist.  Better too large and long than too small.  I'll just have to do some alterations.  One star for the Light Steel.  Five stars for the Slate Heather!  Was not able to see how to order the petit length size."
3.0,Too large. Had to return Too large. Had to return
3.0,"No drawstring makes these hard to fit These pants are an excellent value and are made well.  They are baggy legs, open at the ankles (no cuffs) with a wide elastic waist.  They might have worked for me except the waist was much too large and there is no drawstring to cinch the waist tighter.  Also note that there are no pockets."
3.0,"Too large I am size 10-12 and always buy size L for leggings, sweatpants, pajama bottoms, etc.  Hanes size L sweatpants are huge. Size 16, I think. I still kept them. Just pinched around the waist to keep them from falling down. I bought them for fall yard work. They are warm enough for cool weather and I don't mind looking ""bunchy"" in my backyard."
3.0,"Runs way to big! I do 'like' them but MOST DEFINITELY  but at least a size down!!!! I figured a large, I like stuff loose, but read it ran small, so I got a medium. Well let's just say.....they want to fall off my rear end! Guess I should've gotten a small!  Oh well guess I will be sewing them tighter.1Feel is great, just way to big"
3.0,"Don't want your money These are not worth buying.they run really big in the waist.I normally wear a XL , bought them 3 times trying to find a size to actually fit. Med fit, but then I washed them and the length drew up so much, that now they are above my ankles. I am 5"" 6 . Shouldn't have drew up like this."
3.0,Sweat pants Extra large pants. Order one size smaller
3.0,"About what I expected for the price I wanted some sweat pants as the last pair of mine was falling apart. Ive had these for a month and they are already pilling and growing holes at the seams, despite being big on me. But, they're okay so long as you aren't in the market for something that is going to stay looking nice."
3.0,"I'm a bit disappointed, although they'd make good pajamas.  Thank goodness they were inexpensive. They were advertised as 'petite'.  I'm 5'4"" and I walk on the hems they are so long!!  The legs are gigantic width and do not look as pictured."
3.0,XL is VERY XL... :-( I have hanes leggings XL..a nd they fit perfectly. these 'sweatpants' are REALLY HUGE. disappointed.
3.0,"Way big First I was buying these for someone else, I needed something comfy for them. But they are way big. Ordered a small and they fit myself a 5' 7"" 157lb woman. I will keep cause luckily they fit myself but deff wont work for who I needed them for üòî"
3.0,"Huge at waist These pants are way too big. I am almost 5'6"" and I weigh about 130 lbs. I bought a size S which is marked to correspond to size 4-6. This is a loose size 6 if not a size 8. The length is fine and the fabric is soft. If they had a size XS available, I would exchange the size."
3.0,"Way too big These are cut large, so order down. Unfortunately, I cannot, I ordered small, I'm 5'6"" 105 lbs, and these pants don't even pretend to stay up. And there's no way to tighten them."
3.0,"Size runs large. XL is very large and pant leg length is very long.  I can still use them, but will try a large next time.  They do seem to be made with a fabric that will last a long time.  All in all, a good value for $11."
3.0,They are comfortable but run real big! Runs too big
3.0,"NOT SIZED CORRECTLY Beautiful but...the medium dropped to my ankles and I normally wear an 8/10 medium (5'4"" and 125lbs) the small also fell off of my hips.  The waist is not sized correctly and there is no way to tighten it."
3.0,These are not sized properly I have many pairs of these sweatpants all in size medium. 2 of the newer pairs have a smaller waist than normal and the 3rd pair has a larger waist than normal. The sizing was quite a disappointment and I will either return them or donate them. On a positive note these are very comfy pants especially with the open bottom and they wash well.
3.0,"Not what I hoped for. These pants are low rise with a wide band. They do not offer the rear coverage I expected. They actually fit me fairly well in the hips, but I wanted something warmer and they drag on the floor. My inseam is 30"". I'll keep these pants, but they are wimpy sloppy bottoms. Ok for sleeping, but not nearly as warm as I hoped."
3.0,"Yo uso talla L , pero este pantal√≥n la talla L es muy grande,. Me agrado la tela suave y perfecto para el fr√≠o, la talla L es c√≥mo XL."
3.0,"Runs large but comfortable and affordable I'm so used to ordering clothes from overseas that I forgot how big American sizes are. These pants are extremely comfortable but very, very big. I could have gone down two sizes and still probably had extra room. I'm keeping them because the price is great, and they're really soft and warm without being hot."
3.0,These are ok. Fabric started to pill the first day of wear. More of inconvenience. Better woven fabric could probably prevent this.
3.0,"A good value They saying, you get what you pay for, fits pretty well. For the price, I can't expect $20 sweat pants. There is some pilling of the fiber, so I won't expect them to last a long time, but I didn't expect it to happen with the first washing. I had some Marine Corps sweats for ten years and they never pilled. These have no pockets, so if that matters to you, then be advised. the lower part of the pant leg is just as wide as the top, which seems a bit strange. But if that doesn't matter to you, then you'll be okay. On the plus side they fit as expected and are comfortable."
3.0,"Pros and Cons for these sweatpants Pros:  (1. Material is nice. Not too  heavy. Has a nice sheen, so nicer looking than most sweats. 2. Placement on waist and length were good. I am 5'4"" (3) Price - only $7.00 and delivered!!Cons: 1. Too big on me. But I likely ordered too large a size. I have a pair of size L (a different brand) that shrunk and are way too short (although they fit otherwise). I bought an XL for these, thinking they'd shrink. They shrunk very little.2. NO POCKETS!  This was a big bummer, but they were $7.00 so hard to complain.  I didn't notice when I ordered them."
3.0,"run very big wife has been wearing hanes fleece sweatpants for a few years--always order a medium--29"" waist- when these arrived they were enormous --waist measure approx 35"" as well as being fuller all over--returned them--no problem-- but would not trust sizing purchasing them here again."
3.0,"Good quality fabric The pants are of good fabric. I needed them to wear at home to feel comfortable and  warm. The size, however is a problem: ‚ÄúMedium‚Äù, length is just right for me, but the waistline is way TOO BIG. I am not too tall. (5‚Äô6‚Äù). Not too skinny, rather average. Why make such enormous waist?"
3.0,"A little too large. I didn‚Äôt know which reviews to believe, whether too large or just right. I went with just right but they are too large! Just too loose around the waist. They don‚Äôt fall off, but I prefer them a little more snug. They are fine for wearing around the house."
3.0,Runs large I bought large. I'm 5'4 and weigh 135  female.  But the pants didn't fit me  too big on waiste and told long for legs. But felt comfy. I gave them to my brother who is 5'8. And weighs 185. And they fit him well. Went below his ankle. he likes them. Next time I will order a small
3.0,"Falling apart after one wear... Fit is fine. These are very comfortable. My complaint is that I wore and washed them ONCE and the seem in the thigh ripped open. They are not tight, in fact I ordered way too big. I wore them around the house, nothing crazy. No reason they should fall apart, they are just made poorly."
3.0,"I like the material, but sadly; BOTH sets of sweatpants are too big Will need to take them to a tailor to get them fitted."
3.0,"No waist elastic I purchased a large size to fit my hips, but I have a smaller waist. I don‚Äôt recall that it said the waist was not elasticized, but there is no elastic in the waist. The waist is huge but the pants are still nice. I will add my own elastic."
3.0,They‚Äôre okay Won‚Äôt buy again women‚Äôs pants are not very comfortable and they are just okay
3.0,Not what I expected size-wise The thickness of the material is nice and warm for winter.  The pants are VERY long and the legs are wide.  I am 5'6 and they still are long for me.  The waist area fits well but the lower half runs big. I ordered a medium.  Normally wear a size 10/11 and weigh 145.
3.0,Fit more like pants than sweatpants I first bought the XL - which is my normal size for sweats as I like them baggy. The XL were tighter in the legs than I like. More like a pant fit than a sweatpants fit for me. I am a pear shape and wear a size 18 jean.  I got the XXL and they‚Äôre very big in the waist. I kept them for lounging around the house but couldn‚Äôt wear them out and about.
3.0,Runs large I would order a size down and they are pretty long
3.0,"Too long! I ordered small since I usually wear size 4-6. Everything was ok except for the length. I am taller than most women my age, but these pants were about 4 inches too long. I will alter them rather than return them. Also, I didn‚Äôt notice, when I preferred them, that they have no pockets. Love pockets."
3.0,"Too Big They are comfortable at the waist and love the thickness of the material...very warm, but way too long and the pant legs are huge.  Not made for ladies with small hips and legs.  Even after I washed and dried them on high heat it didn't do anything but shrink the length a tad."
3.0,Run very large Quality is good but these run very large. Probably should order two sizes smaller than usual.
3.0,The rise of the back of the pants were so low I thought I had them on backwards. The rise is very short in the back. Way too long for a Petite
3.0,"These pants have no shape... I read the reviews and purchased a size smaller than I normally would, which turned out to be a good choice. But when I put these on, it was like they used the exact same pattern for the front and back of the pants. There is no extra room in the back for one‚Äôs rear, so it sits rather low back there. The front, however, bunches up in a strange way with the extra fabric. It‚Äôs just weird.I guess for $5, I‚Äôm not sure what I expected, but it was definitely more than this."
3.0,"Not Inpressed with the Fit I ordered an XL based on the reviews of them running large. The fit in the waist was perfect, however the legs were huge!! They looked like bellbottoms. I opted to keep them instead of returning them due to the fact that I got them at such a great price. Guess i will only be wearing them around the house."
3.0,Pants too long Bought for my gma and they are her size but too long in length.
3.0,For the price they‚Äôre ok These are okay. They begin to pill quickly even when washed in cold and not dried. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9‚Äù so bought a long and the length is good. They fit fine on the hips. They loose their coziness pretty quickly. For the price they‚Äôre fine.
3.0,Not bad for the money The pants are comfortable and fit as expected but I do not think they are durable. Fabric piling up after just the first wash and just getting worse after that.  I was pleased when they first arrived as they were very soft inside but as I wore them the fuzziness clumped up and came off.
3.0,Order a smaller size. Wast band was stretched out. Item was a little large
3.0,"Fit is Too Large - Order Down a Size or Two I ordered a large, but I should have ordered a medium because the large was like wearing an XXL!"
3.0,Se puede pedir un n√∫mero menos Me quedo grande.
3.0,"Not consistent sizes I ordered three pairs. Two of the items - navy heather and slate heather were essentially a 1X and the other ebony is more like an XL. Since they are all labeled the same, it is difficult to figure out how to order more of the ones that do and less of the ones that don't."
3.0,I thought pant said Petit M they have to be a better size chart/
3.0,"Too big and long I bought two pants, grey and black each in small sizes. They were well made pants for the price but were way too big and long for me. I tried to return and buy XS, however they don‚Äôt come in XS. They credited one pants, but not for the other one. Need to speak to Amazon."
3.0,Take a size or two Smaller!!! Made BIG Made too big for size I should have taken a medium!
3.0,Run big. Are these mens? Soft and comfy. Run large. I ordered medium and rolled them down once at the waist and they are still big. Beginning to think they are men‚Äôs sizes
3.0,"Too big! They are typical Hanes sweats. Good quality, and all that jazz. But these babies are way too big. I'm returning them to get a smaller size."
3.0,Wide waist band but no elastic. The waist band has no elastic. I had to add elastic to both pair.
3.0,"Comfortable-ish, wont wear them out of the house The material doesn‚Äôt match what the photo looks like. I found them to be extremely unflattering on me. They are comfortable but I will not be wearing these out of the house. Although what can you really expect from $8 sweatpants. They‚Äôre cheap and do the job of keeping you comfortable."
3.0,"waist too large waist too wide, always have to pull them up"
3.0,Wrong I normally wear size XL and these are not size XL it‚Äôs more of Medium or smaller and I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8‚Äù these are too short
3.0,"Definitely order your pants a size below as they run big They were ok, just wished they were longer"
3.0,Disproportionate sizing Waist is much too wide and a little low.
3.0,not happy not happy
3.0,Too low waisted. These sit too low for my comfort. Definitely below waist on hips. We called these low riders LOL. Don‚Äôt bend over in front of someone! Constantly pulling them up. The material is soft & comfy. Love the color. Miss pockets. I‚Äôm over 60 & would love them if they had a higher waist.
3.0,Really stretchy pants. Order smaller size The pants fit perfectly when first put on but as the day wore on they stretched until I was having to hold them up. The legs began to drag the ground and the waist increased by 2-3 sizes. I plan on ordering the same pants again in smaller sizes.
3.0,Sit to low on waist for older adults Wanted high waist. I may have missed that in descript.
3.0,"way large I bought a size small, and they are tagged a size small, but they look like a a size large."
3.0,"fit runs big, material is very stetchy. waist line is loose"
3.0,"Runs big I am 5'3""; 112 pounds and the small was not small.  Too long and waist is too big.  I tried to shrink; but did not help much.  Good to wear around the house....I fold the waist over once.  The good things: soft and warm."
3.0,Shrunk up after first wash Shrunk after first wash. Rides low on hip
3.0,"Very LARGE. Needs a drawstring Not sure what I was thinking when clearly many people said they run very large? Oh yeah, they were only $7.50 at the time. Well, I put a drawstring through the waist and now have a baggy, warm, very long pair of night pants. Hoping they shrinkü§û"
3.0,"Gentle on the skin Great quality it‚Äôs just me, I purchased an extra large because I usually wear an extra large but the extra large was larger than I expected and is falling off me but it is quite comfortable and the material does not rub my skin wrong. For I have sensitive skin."
3.0,Great quality just to short Loved the quality of pants.Upset they didn't fit.
3.0,"Way, Way too big Nice pair of sweat pants except they are huge for the size ordered."
3.0,"These pants run really large. I am 5'2"" and weigh 145 lbs, and exchanged an xl for a med Way too big.  Exchanged xl for a medium, and they fit fine.  Very comfortable if you get the right size."
3.0,Don‚Äôt buy if you have junk in your trunk Length of the pants is perfect... I‚Äôm 4‚Äô11‚ÄùSoftness and warmth is greatBUT... I have a bigger rear end and these pants do not cover entirely... underwear shows at the top. Size up if you have junk in the trunk! üòä
3.0,"Runs short - tall people beware! I really liked the feel and weight of these but they run short to begin with, and the length shrinks even more when washed.  I could not wear them after washing.  I ordered a large and I'm 5'7"" tall."
3.0,"loose at the waist Bought 2 pairs, but the black pants were about 1cm larger at the waist than the other color."
3.0,Soft but funky sizing Super comfy but way too big! Both pants were also the same size supposedly but one pair was definitely bigger. They were soft enough that I just altered them to fit. Make sure to order at least one size down.
3.0,"loose fit I‚Äôm 5‚Äù tall , I am between M/L so I got Large . Definitely too long , feels warm , loose fit , the waist is too big I‚Äôm going to use them as PJs .  Tag reads L 12/14 so I think I will go for a Medium."
3.0,Too Big These are enormous. I‚Äôm a size small. A 2-4 in pants. Ample bottom. And these were laughably large. I washed them in hopes they‚Äôd shrink enough to just be lounge wear around the house and they‚Äôre still way too big. Can‚Äôt wear.
3.0,"A little disappointing The pants somehow don't look as smart as I'd hoped.The fit is ok, and  I know they're casual, but the fabric is rather coarse so they look cheap to me. Hanes' products are usually high quality fabric, so I was disappointed. I think I'll give them to Goodwill as warm, comfortable and certainly ""lightly used""."
3.0,Baggy and comfortable I should of ordered a size smaller. But I still like them. I lounge around the house in them.
3.0,Runs big Very cozy but too large for me I ordered a medium and exchanged for a small and still had to return :/
3.0,"Waist on pants runs extremely large The waist of these pants runs extremely large. I ordered a medium, a size I always am and that fits good with other products. The waist easily must be a large to extra large in measurement. It's disappointing because the things and butt are slightly tight and the pants are just a tad too short. They really need to rework their measurements for this product. But material is soft and cozy."
3.0,"Good sleepers These Hanes sweat pants are ordinary, basic sweats for at home wear. My only issue is they don't have pocketsand being a ""pocket freak"" is a downer for me. Other than that, they are ok. They are very long, which is good, because you can adjust the length with scissors if too long, or leave them alone."
3.0,"Didn‚Äôt last very long I really liked these sweatpants.. they were very comfy, and fit just right.. but I have thick thighs, so after the first week of wearing them, they started to chafe and made a hole in the crotch"
3.0,Poorly designed. I put that these for too large but it‚Äôs only half true. They‚Äôd be great if the waistband was designed better. There‚Äôs no elastic or drawstring so they just fall down. There‚Äôs nothing to keep them in place. It‚Äôs ridiculous.
3.0,"must have wrong size label I bought these for my 160 lb mom she has been wearing xl. After reading reviews I decided to get large. They look good nice color & material, but they were so big they fell off her."
3.0,"The piling! These are great if it wasn‚Äôt for the piling falling out as you walk through the house and then you spend all day picking it up. So frustrating. It continues after washing too. So, they are relegated to only wear in the yard."
3.0,"Gray is not the same style as black I'd previously ordered in black, & liked it enough to order another one in gray. Not the same style much to my dismay. The legs are huge; almost looks like I'm wearing a skirt"
3.0,"Runs large I ordered these knit pants just to wear around the house, and they are ok for that, however they run very big and I had to take up the length and waist. I would advise you to order a size smaller than you usually wear."
3.0,Horrible fit They just can‚Äôt get it right. The sizes are funky. Two long waist has a bad gaping fit. My sister is usually a medium they were too big so I sent them back and got a small still really horrible fit.
3.0,Run large and long. As many of the reviews state these run large and long. I would return them but I‚Äôm having foot surgery and need a large leg opening due to bandaging. I will most likely take them in at the waist and use them for sleeping after I recover.
3.0,Nice sweats but run to large should of got small Not true too size should of got small
3.0,Buy smaller than you think you need. Way too big even after wash and dry.
3.0,Runs really large large large Nice material for Basic gray sweats but I would encourage you to buy a size lower is the normal medium I wear swim on me and would not even stay up on my waist but no worries I‚Äôm a competent seamstress
3.0,"Could have used a drawstring These are nice as far as sweatpants go, but they run a  bit large, and there is no drawstring. Have to figure out a way to fix them so they don't fall down. But they are cozy, and not tight on your ankles like old fashioned sweatpants."
3.0,You get what you pay for. These sweatpants are very comfortable but the below-the-waist fit did not work for me. Always felt like they were falling down. They are magnets for lint and pet hair. They also instantly develop many little balls of fabric along and above the hem and any place they rub. I finally threw them away. (You get what you pay for!)
3.0,"Wrong size sent! Love the pants just received wrong size, I ordered two pair in size small, was sent size large‚Ä¶. Unable to wear"
3.0,"Runs Short! I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5, 129 pounds and ordered a medium. I am disappointed that they run short. I ordered a medium and they fit just above the ankle! I love how soft and warm they are and seem to be good quality. If they had pockets, I‚Äôd order a large next time."
3.0,Larger than expected Pants were a few inches way too long.
3.0,"Loose at waist I like the fabric. However, there is no way to adjust the waist to fit more securely. It needs drawstrings or tighter elastic. Kept it anyway."
3.0,"They run large. I'm normally a large sometimes medium if the clothing runs large, but with these even the medium is big for me. I'm 5'8"" and 155 lbs."
3.0,"comfortable but not sturdy Comfortable and decent looking, but they wear out too quickly. I bought three pairs of these, and it didn't take long for the thigh area to pill up and eventually develop holes in all of them. They are cheap though, so I guess you get what you pay for."
3.0,Too big I usually wear a large but these are way too big I could‚Äôve probably fit a small the way they run
3.0,"Hmmmmm I am 5'2""  130lbs ordered a medium they were 2"" too long and baggy. I took them up and kept them because of the price but they are not something I will wear out except in the yard."
3.0,The pants ran way to small Product was to small and don't feel well enough mail back
3.0,Way too big! I wear a size 8 & ordered a medium. They were way too big! I couldn't even keep them up.
3.0,"Pedir 1 talle m√°s chico,hace pelotitas en la tela pero se deforma Es la segunda vez que compro el art√≠culo y ped√≠ un talle m√°s chico pues el primero que ped√≠ L,qued√≥ muy flojo y largo.El M es muy largo tb pero se ajusta mucho mejor ,al no tener cordones no hay donde ajustar cintura .Se hacen pelotitas con el uso pero no se deforma."
3.0,"Material, poor quality. Not pleasant to wear, poor quality."
3.0,"Tight in the Rear These pants are comfortable but it takes time. If you have a large rear end, it will be difficult to pull them all the way up in the back. The front fits fine. Eventually the fabric will stretch and fit over your bum. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend these pants for larger individuals."
3.0,"Sizing chart clearly wrong I'm glad I ordered small instead of what the chart suggested would be a medium. These are made on the large side with no draw string so they are loose fitting. I am giving them a 3 star as I will require some loose fitting sweat pants in the coming months, but I hope I don't loose much weight during that time or these will fall down my legs."
3.0,Ok Soft but size was to big. On pant legs were to big. Not fitted on bottom.
3.0,"Large and Long These inexpensive pants are cut very large, no tie at the waist to adjust and way too long; however, for the price, since I know how to use needle and thread, I will shorten and add a waist tie and they will be fine."
3.0,"Waiting for a flood The pants shrunk vertically-  Which is disappointing.  I now have 3‚Äù of skin exposed between my ankle sock and the pants.  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9‚Äù.....  and have longer legs, but this is a tad beyond ‚Äúnormal‚Äù.  Other than that-  they are very comfortable."
3.0,"Not very happy I bought 4 pants in different colors for my wife, the light colors are fine, but the dark ones are terrible, they give off a lot of lint that stays in the underwear, on the skin and in the washing machine. Lint everywhere. That did not like her"
3.0,"When reviewers said to go down a size they were right I went down a size thinking size small would be perfect.  I opened the package and the sweats looked like a large.  I should have gone to an extra-small.  I'm going to wash them and throw them in the dryer.  Hopefully, they will shrink.  Other than that, I do like the quality and style."
3.0,Pants run big Good quality but run big
3.0,Great price very soft and comfy Great price. These pants are super soft and cozy. Ordered what I thought was my size but were much larger. Gave to my daughter and she said they‚Äôre so comfy. They do run short inseam so if your taller might not be a good choice.
3.0,Product is fine but the smallest size was way too big Nothing against the product but clearly the size is not appropriate for a petite person even though I ordered the smallest size they had. I think the structure of the pants would be just fine if the entire unit was about 35% smaller proportionally
3.0,"They grow 'em big at Hanes! I have now have Thanksgiving and Cmas dinner pants!!!!! While these are really comfy and fine for the price, they are HUGE! I could have fit both myself AND myself again in these. I always wear XLRG, but these babies are E-X-T-R-A-E-X-T-R-A-L-A-R-G-E! So be aware of that when you purchase."
3.0,better desceiption would have liked side pockets
3.0,"Look like clown pants on me Was disappointed in the way these fit.  They are a little too long and the pants legs are very wide.  Have ordered these before and they were perfect, so either ordered a different style by mistake or Hanes is making them different.  Would not wear them anywhere, but could possibly use them for lounging or may give to charity.  They are inexpensive and the colors are good, so was just disappointed in the fit.  Could almost get both my legs into one of the pant legs - that's how wide they are."
3.0,"Petite? I ordered a petite which should have been perfect length, but they were way to long, so I had togo to the task of hemming them....if I order a petite I shouldn't have to do that."
3.0,"Runs Big I purchased a size small but when I got these fit more like a medium or large.  OK for lounging around house or yard work, but not for wearing elsewhere.  Would appreciate extra small in this product line,"
3.0,"Poor fit, too lightweight. For sweats, the fabric was too lightweight.  They were about 3 inches too long, they fit below the waist, which is not what I was expecting, and were too large in the waist, with no drawstring to adjust them. Poor fit."
3.0,Legs too wide as tripping is a problem Pant legs too wide
3.0,"My problem, i ordered too large Soft material, great price but definitely way to big . Order in your normal size no matter how big and comfortable you want,"
3.0,Cool weather pants I can‚Äôt stay these pants are very stylish but definitely a cold weather pant for around the house.  I had to hem up about 2 inches even after multiple washings.
3.0,"Run big These pants run on the big size. I'm 5.5 1/2, 130 lbs and usually wear a med/size 8.  These pants are more like a mid rise, longer and wider in the waist. There is no string to  adjust. I could have gone to a small. They kind of bunch up in the area of the waist until the leg. I may try to shrink them but they are comfy. So that's a plus. They are light weight."
3.0,Runs Way Big This was way too big for it's size but arrived in a timely manner
3.0,"Just know they run really big! Im usually an XL in everything and for height reference I am 5'8, but they fit really big on me and were falling off. I should have gotten a size large and on top of that they were really long on me. I had to pull them up and roll down the waist band to keep these on."
3.0,Great value Great value for the price ‚Äî length would be super if I were 4‚Äù taller then 5‚Äô4‚Äù.  I‚Äôm concerned about how the waist elastic will stand the test of time... but at this price who cares if it‚Äôs only one season.
3.0,"Very light weight. Far thinner material than expected.  Yes, it seems to be sweatshirt-like, but light weight.  I have other similar pants I adore that are more typical weight.  You get what you pay for, I guess.  No pockets.  Yes, I saw that in the description, but still irritating."
3.0,No pockets. I was enamored of the description and the reviews. I like the fabric. I like the fit except that it kind of cut me in the crotch. The length is fine. But no pockets. What's with this pants with no pockets. I don't understand.
3.0,"No pockets! How the heck are we at this day and age and still don't have pockets. Next time I'll just order the men's.However, they are comfy but a little poofy right below the waist."
3.0,read description carefully Would be better if the pants had pockets.  If I had noticed they did not have pockets I probably would not have ordered them.  Pockets are very important to me as I work in a hospital and need pockets
3.0,Too large Did not like the fit.
3.0,"They run Big! Not sure about the feel of the fabric. I ordered according to guide. XL. Too Big.  5‚Äô4‚Äù, hips 43‚Äù, 200 lbs. My  leg is 28 1/2. Pants leg was ok. Fabric is ok.  Smooth, very casual.The legs are stovepipe at top, then narrow below the knee, and ankle."
3.0,"Check the seams - both pair I ordered had rips in the seam Unfortunately, I had not checked the seams when I first got this.  But after washing and putting them on I discovered the stitching in the croch (sp?) was missing in sections."
3.0,Warning - No Drawstring These do not have a Drawstring closure as the listing mentions.
3.0,Not so good It got those furry white balls after one wash in the crotch area really irritating
3.0,"Nice n thick I ordered an XL,which I normally get 16-18 but it runs really big like a size 20."
3.0,Loose fitting pants I bought a medium and it was too large and long even after washing.
3.0,Sizes run big Sizes run big keep that in mind when ordering. I always wear medium sweats. so that‚Äôs what I ordered and had to return as they were too big
3.0,"Hate the hip-hugger I bought Medium, and it fits pretty well, but I hate the hip-hugger rise.  The length is okay until the waistband starts sliding down my hips until I'm stepping on the bottom of the pants.  I'll probably need to add another waistband on top of the one it came with.  The pants are a good value, but I end up pulling them up all the time."
3.0,Not the Same Quality as Prior Ones I Purchased Through the Years. I have purchased this brand of sweatpants for years but always from Walmart. They were out of stock so I found them on Amazon. Fit is no where near the others I purchased in the past. Even though the same size I always buy the waist was 2‚Äù larger. Material was also a lot thinner than the others. Very disappointed Hanes changed the quality. Will be looking for another brand for future
3.0,"Nice thick material but too short The pants are nice and warm feeling,  the waist and rise is perfect except the length is at least 3 inches too short.  For reference,  I am 5'9"" tall with short torso and long legs. I bought the small."
3.0,Waist band The pants waist elastic band is not tight enough so they have to be worn with a belt. Both material fabric and color are good.
3.0,"Buy Small, Look Comfy I wear a size 14-16 jeans so I ordered an XL... These fit my friend who wears a 3X. Don't know if it was my fault or theirs but I recommend buying a smaller size than needed."
3.0,"Waist is too big The waist for this pants is just too big, and there is no string to make the waist elastic so I am thinking of returning it even though the overall quality is not bad at all."
3.0,"Order a size down from what you normally wear; the sizing is way too generous! Super comfy...only problem is...they are too big!  I normally wear Ladies ""Medium"" or size 8-10, but the ""8-10"" are more like size ""10-12"" with these pants.  I would have kept these if they weren't so big!"
3.0,"Way too large I am a tall woman. I usually wear Xl or around a 14-16. These are way to huge in the hip, and there's no drawstring. I have to hold them up to walk in them."
3.0,I love these sweatpants I should have got a smaller size but I love these pants they were a little big I got a 2X next time I will get a extra large
3.0,"Too big but well made 5‚Äô5‚Äù 119 pounds, bought a size small and these are too big. They are way too long and the waist is too big.I kept as I can‚Äôt find any in the stores right now. They are well made."
3.0,"Oversized These are very over-sized... which is what I wanted.  I wear them over my leggings to stay warm in the winter.  I wouldn't go out in public in them though.  Washed them in hot water, then dried them in the dryer for maximum shrinkage - still very baggy.  I'm 5'4"" and weight 150lbs, apple shaped lady.  I bought the large size.  They are BIG!"
3.0,"Good value, would pay a little more for a drawstring Great value for money, but elastic seems it will loosen up quickly. Without a drawstring I'm worried these won't last really long. Otherwise,  I love that these are a basic simple sweatpant."
3.0,"These run 2 sizes too big These run very, very big"
3.0,Not long enough for a 5‚Äô11‚Äù tall gal Ordered XXL and I‚Äôm a 20/22 and 5‚Äô11‚Äù.The pants fit in the waist and thighs but are too short. When I sit down you can see 3‚Äù of skin - I HATE that. I really wanted TALL pants.
3.0,Comfortable It was comfortable but fabric on the thick side. Better for winter months.
3.0,Small is actually a large Very large. Will return
3.0,"Perfect until washed Love the fit and comfort, they are just super short in the legs, I‚Äôd never wear these out of the house.  They fit great in leg length until they were washed, they shrunk up many inches"
3.0,I would not recommend these pants. I ordered a size medium and they run a little large. The quality is not as good as they used to be. The fabric also pills pretty bad after a few washings. I do not recommend these pants.
3.0,Really big I‚Äôm between a large and an extra large and so got the xl for extra comfort. These were so big they fell to the ground and so are unwearable. In the donation bin they go.
3.0,Order a size smaller.  Mine were huge on me. Good material but not true to size.  Order a size smaller.
3.0,"Run big and long Bought a size small, 5 ft 4 inches normally wear a 4 or 6, longggg and very loose, baggy bottom. I will look for a Children's large next time I buy Hanes sweats. Soft and fleecy inside."
3.0,"Dies not fit the female shape well. Not enough fabric in the back and too much in the front.  I first thought the put the tag on the wrong side.  Nope, just the same cut front and back.  If you have any back end or not enough front they fit odd.  Cheap though so I still wear them around the house."
3.0,"Great for cold weather wear Wear around the house. Had to put a drawstring in them to keep them up.  They fit around the hips, but the legs are really wide and the pants are long. Fabric is sweat pants"
3.0,"the waist of the pants is so so so big like size L I got the pants yesterday, my size is generally S, but this size S pants of the waist  is so so so so big, I am so disappointed, but I am lazy to return it."
3.0,"Too short in length for average height people Overall, the fit around the waist and legs were ok but the length is way to short for the average person. I ordered a medium and a large for my mom and both were too short. This would be ok for a very short person."
3.0,"Size Down as stated When description says runs large so size down, they werent kidding.  Fits very loose even a size down.  After washing pants fit to form but soon stretch. Definitely size down.  Good value for winter wear so bought 5."
3.0,Thin Wasn't as thick as I hoped for it to be
3.0,"Size runs larger than expected. Super soft and comfortably very large. I am usually an xl...these are really big with no tie around waist to tighten them up...but they are soft and comfy for around the house....oh and kind of short..as I am 5'8""..."
3.0,"Petite lengths?? I guess I didn't order the petite, because I had to cut off about 6 inches from these pants... They're a bit tight, but then my fat butt could stand to lose a few pounds..."
3.0,"Sizing is off These are two sizes too large.  I wear a medium pant - 38"" hip and 29"" waist.  I ordered these in various colors in both small and medium.  Both sizes are too large.  Unfortunately there is no extra small size offered.  As for the fabric- the inside is very soft and fleecy.  The outside isn't super soft and feels like it won't stay comfortable through many washings. The elastic also doesn't have much give.  At $8 each these could be replaced regularly but the sizing is way off."
3.0,"product as described This was the 3rd. pair of Hanes Ecosmart Women's pants that I have ordered this year. This pair, Navy Heather, does not fit as the other 3 did, and the label isn't marked Ecosmart either. I am returning these due to the fit."
3.0,"Too long. Maybe I pressed a wrong button when ordering.  I thought it would be petite, but they are several inches too long.Also, my cat stepped on my phone and gave the delivery a bad rating.  Actually, delivery was perfect."
3.0,"Comfy, but starting to fall apart These are super comfy. I‚Äôve bought three of them since starting to work from home. However, in 6 months, these have started to pill and the seams come apart around my thighs. Not a very durable product, but they fit well!"
3.0,"Soft, but shrink! I loved these on first wear, however they shrink. The fit was perfect until I washed them, shrunk more than an inch in length and a bit elsewhere. They are soft. Will not order again."
3.0,These were supposed to be petite.! Advertised as petite but were about 6 inches to long.
3.0,"Big, no pockets. I ordered the size based on the chart and I wish I had ordered a size smaller. No pockets is a drag. But they are warm and comfy."
3.0,Way to big Order a medium and it's like XL or bigger.
3.0,"These run very large. The pants ran very large at the waist, and the small fit more like I would expect from a size large. They were so loose on me that they wouldn‚Äôt even stay up."
3.0,"Sizes run way BIG!! Very comfortable material, but sizes run very large!! I ordered a small and length was good (I am 5'7""), but the pants were huge everywhere...waist, hips, thighs. I ended up getting a refund, as they do not come in Xsmall and would most likely be too short if they did...small petite would definitely be too short."
3.0,Too big. But so comfy They are super soft and comfy!! But the size isn‚Äôt correct. The medium is 8/10. I was expecting somewhere around size 6. And there is no drawstring.  But I would love to get a correct size!
3.0,Not Gung Ho About Them The pants fuzz quite a bit. I have to wear only black or dark colour undies with them. The legs are pretty straight too. I find they look a tad big...
3.0,Not for walking or exercise Pilling happened where thighs rub together after just a few wearings as pyjama pants and subsequent washings. Don't expect them to hold up well.
3.0,Perfect before washing These are perfect before you wash them. After one wash they shrunk about 2 inches in length and one whole overall size.
3.0,"Pants Fall down The fabric is soft and warm, the length appropriate. However, the waist is too loose. There is no indentation at the waist from the hip width. Even though there is an elastic waistband, it has no tension. Can expand, but not hold the pants up"
3.0,They are over sized Wasn't happy to have to return two of them because they were over sized
3.0,Runs big Didn‚Äôt even get to use them because they ran way too big a small was huge. I recommend you get a size smaller maybe even two since they run big.
3.0,Very short waist They don't have much rise at the waist. I bent over before wearing in public and they didn't cover what they should have. I wear around the house but not in public
3.0,Runs Large These pants are warm and comfortable. They are big and very long but length will shrink up after washing. I could have used a size smaller. Order your normal size to prevent baggyness.
3.0,Fit strange The legs are long and waist loose but run short in crotch.  There was a small hole in leg by knee that I didn‚Äôt see until after a threw away receipt.  Not quality I expected
3.0,Ran a little large I ordered these pants and they were too large. I received my refund but amazon told me I did not have to return the pants. I really want to send them back I have no use for them. Help me amazon.
3.0,No shape and a little big These will work around the house but do not fit like other Hanes sweats. They have no shape and run big but not worth the effort to try and return
3.0,"Very Comfortable These pants are very comfy and warm, but just a little too short for me.. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8‚Äù so most regular pants are, although sometimes i get a surprise fit, but these were just a little too short, but still keeping them!"
3.0,"Not what I ordered but ok... I ordered ebony but got dark grey and they are fitted at the ankle not loose ankle as shown. Didn‚Äôt feel like bothering with a return but yeah, not what I ordered"
3.0,"Loose Waist - Good for Around the House Waist is very loose.  Waist sits mid rise; however, if you bend over, the waist creeps down.  I‚Äôm only wearing these around the house.  There‚Äôs no way I would wear these in public! The interior material has little bits of fabric that fluff off.  When I took off the pants, black bits were all over the floor.  They are toasty and keep you warm."
3.0,"Run big very long Have not worn yet need to cut at least 3 inches off the bottom. I am only 5'0 but usually don't have such a problem they are usually about and inch too long when I pull up high but these are 3-4"" otherwise ok sweatpants"
3.0,"Runs long These are nice sweatpants except I step in them. They are extremely long and I ordered petite and am 5'4""."
3.0,warm & cozy Long on me (5‚Äô3) but i just cut them to fit me coz im wearing them in the house as pjs. no fraying so far and ive washed them plenty of time. No pockets!! and they are warm & cozy!
3.0,MINE DID NOT RUN LARGE I am a normal medium. I wear a size 7/8. The description says it runs large. The small fits a little too tight. I'm trying the medium next time.UPDATE: Medium fits perfectly but after a few washes the material beads.
3.0,"Too big 5‚Äô4‚Äù 175lbs, so I got the LARGE.Way too big, requested a refund. Should‚Äôve gone with (probably) a small, but now I‚Äôll look elsewhere and for a pair with pockets."
3.0,GREAT QUALITY BUT TOO HEAVY WEIGHT FOR ME Fabric was heavier than I needed for indoor use.
3.0,"Too large at the waist I bought the next size down, due to someone else's suggestion, but it was still large at the waist.  Other than that, find the sweat pants to be quite comfortable."
3.0,"OK pants Pant's are fine, I need to check details better as I must have pockets. I have had these before (store bought) and after a few months the fleece lining became rough and very uncomfortable. My fault I didn't pay more attention to what I was buying."
3.0,"Fits larger and frumpier than expected. Baggier than I thought. Even after washing, they fit sort of frumpy. At least more so than the pic implies. I‚Äôd get a smaller size next time."
3.0,No pocketsüôÑ No pocketsüôÑ. Didn't notice that before ordering. Wouldn't men be mad if no pockets on theirs?
3.0,Too big I normally wear a size large but these pants were too big.
3.0,Pretty good product It was soft and real comfy but the item was really long (not made for us short people in mind) and way too big. I ordered a large but should have gone to a medium.  But still a good product.
3.0,"Size down Honestly not the best fit for me. Very long and runs a little big around the hip.. quality is not the worst, but don‚Äôt expect too much. I recommend going a size down."
3.0,uncomfortably small for me & everyone else Very tight in the waistband & hips. Much smaller than size chart indicated. Disappointed & unable to wear.
3.0,Baggy fit and no pockets. Baggy and no pockets.
3.0,They run huge! They seem well made. But they run very large.
3.0,Waist is way too oversized The waist is oversized with not enough elastic. Bought a medium. I like the fit and length but the waist falls down-very disappointed with that. Nothing wrong with material or softness so that‚Äôs good.
3.0,"Runs large Legs are wide and loose, and long. Got a medium . Am 5‚Äô2‚Äù‚Äù and 135.  This is a big medium! Definitely runs on the large side ."
3.0,Order a size smaller These sweatpants are soft and comfortable. Ordered two pair of the same size and color and one pair is bigger and longer. They're ok around the house. No pockets.
3.0,"Small good for a 6, may be too big for a 4. Runs a little big. I read the reviews prior to ordering. I'm 5'6"", around 125lbs to 130lbs. Upon opening the bags I thought they were way too big. I ordered small size. I thought about returning all 3 but decided to wash and dry one first. After drying I think they did shrink some, enough to avoid a return. If I was closer to am size 4 then I think they would be too big. I rolled the waist to cut down on the excess crotch area/shorten the length. For $8/ea it's a decent deal."
3.0,"Fit well except photo shows more of a straight leg & these are more like bell bottoms :-( I like the fit however, the photo of these shows a definite straight leg; the ones I rec'd are more like bell bottoms???? I'm not sure I will keep them, sadly...."
3.0,"Not for tall women. They didn't fit right. To short, I am 5'7"", I should have read pant leg length. .  Waist is to large, mid length, big muffin top problem for me."
3.0,"Very long........ Pants would be great if I were very tall, but they are a good 4-5 inches too long.  I thought they could be ordered in lengths, but not so............."
3.0,Cheap Very comfortable. I like that it doesn't have elastic at the ankles. Unfortunately the seam on 1 leg ripped while I was wearing them for the first time.
3.0,NOT AS DESCRIBED. THE QUALITY OF PANTS IS GOOD AND ARE COMFORTABLE AS THEY ARE VERY LOOSE AT WAIST  BUT SMALL WOULD FIT A MEDIUM OR LARGE AS THEY CERTAINLY DO NOT FIT A SMALL.  I AM 5 FT 3 INCHES AND WEIGH 130 SO I AM NOT  PETITE BUT THEY SWALLOW ME.  I CAN ONLY HOPE THEY SHRINK A LITTLE IN THE WASH.
3.0,"Good EXCEPT One leg is about 1 1/2 to almost 2 inches shorter than the other leg!!!! Otherwise these would have gotten 5 stars as they fit as expected, are comfortable and look nice...except the shorter leg!!!!"
3.0,"Bummer I take a large in sweat pants and these run 2 sixes bigger , if I knew this I would have gotten Medium Pete then I wouldnt have to pull cloths over to keep them from falling lol. Also in the legs with this size if needed has lots of room to"
3.0,BAGGY I am 5'2'' and 138lbs. Had read the reviews before purchasing this. This pant is credibly LARGE. It was like I am swimming there. The material is not that good as well.
3.0,"Wide waist, no pockets These are very soft and comfy to wear, but the waist is pretty wide. It doesn't have a drawstring, so it's loose at the waist. Also, when I ordered I didn't realize that they don't have pockets--did see that in the description."
3.0,Too loose These are nice and warm and a really good price but not enough elastic in the waist. They are very loose with no way to keep them up.
3.0,Inconsistent sizing the sizing on these pants is really inconsistent. I ordered a gray pair that was kind of baggy but comfortable for wearing around the house. So I ordered a pair of black and the rise is so low that I have to tug to get them on and they keep slipping down.
3.0,Runs big Good quality but way too big and they don't shrink enough.  Buy at least one size smaller.  Also the legs are very wide.  Doesn't rise to the waist but just below.
3.0,SWEAT PANTS I DIDN'T REVIEW THE PRODUCT AS CLOSELY AS I SHOULD HAVE.  I LIKE SWEAT PANTS TO FIT AT THE WAIST AND HAVE POCKETS AND A BANDED LOG BOTTOM.
3.0,"Sizing I am a size large which is to long , I am 5‚Äô2 160 pounds and I think a size medium in pants would fit us girlies ! Hopefully it helps"
3.0,Size Small is like size XL Size Small is like size XL
3.0,"Nice and warm, but long and baggy I'm 5'4"" and need to roll the waistband on a Small.  They're quite baggy, which is fine for around the house, but I'd never wear them out anywhere.  They're also warm, so I'm keeping them for winter."
3.0,Nice material very large Nice material I‚Äôll use for pjs I bought medium what I usually buy in pants and they are really long and wideGood price I‚Äôll use for pj bottoms
3.0,"Very baggy I know they're sweatpants, but these are extremely large. I had to return them. Giving this product three stars because I didn't get a chance to wear them and can't critique their construction."
3.0,Too big Way too big and I ordered a small
3.0,Wider and tall 2X than I expected. Somewhat large around waist but helpful if I plan on eating a big meal.  Length is too long so I need to get these hemmed.  Otherwise comfortable and durable material.
3.0,"Thin fabric I normally wear sweat pants to do chores around the farm during the winter.  These are a bit thin, a bit big, way too long but wash up very well."
3.0,Runs very large Great comfortable around house sweats!
3.0,Different Colors have COMPLETELY Different Sizing Bought these sweat pants in Ebony and they were fine. Ordered in two other colors and they are much larger in waist and length in comparison.
3.0,"Too big I wanted warm pants to wear at night.  This pair is more large than medium.  I hoped they would shrink a little after washing, but they didn‚Äôt."
3.0,"itchy fabric The pants are OK, but they make me itch very bad. If you have sensitive skin like me, I would not recommend these to you, other than that they are fine. I did not return it anyways since I can wear them with leggings in cold weather."
3.0,Comfortable but big Comfy but bigger then thought. Runs long. For cold weather too
3.0,"If you are a small, buy an extra small.  They run large. Run large. The fabric was really soft and I liked that."
3.0,Awkward fit The front of the waist comes up high and the back sits very low.The material is soft and comfortable
3.0,"Medium too big for me , Runs big Good material, not too thick but runs huge . The medium is like a large. Had to return . I am 5'2 , 117 lbs ."
3.0,"Not the right fit. I think I would have liked them had they fit, I normally wear a size medium pants and that‚Äôs what I ordered but theses was way to long and the legs was very wide,"
3.0,"If you are at least 5'7"" these would work 5'2"" - they were too long for me.  I found them to be thick sweatshirt material."
3.0,"Too big These are really loose at the waist. Pretty much falling down. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4 and 120 pounds, usually a size small/medium. Otherwise, they‚Äôre super soft and great for the price."
3.0,"Nice and warm I liked the heaviness of the sweats, however, there are no tie strings to tighten them off.  I will need to cut a whole in them and string it thru."
3.0,Already has two holes andt I've had then for 3 days. I really like the thickness of the fabric. However I just got them on Sunday and there are already two holea near one of the seams. Might need to ask for refund.
3.0,"A small size seems like a large size. Pants seems two size larger than the small I ordered. I would return them except, unfortunately, I threw the packaging away."
3.0,"Not thrilled with these. Bought these and was not thrilled with them.  A bit wide on the leg, kinda short for the fit and just ok material."
3.0,Size small fits in waistband and nowhere else Really hoped these pants would work great.  The waist fit well.  The legs were huge and also super-long.  I appreciated the seller reimbursing me for these pants.
3.0,Runs big I ordered these in small and they're huge. For reference I am 135 lbs and about 3 months post partum. I would definitely size down when ordering.
3.0,Pants Pants are okay but runs large. Even the smallest size was too big.
3.0,"Size issue. Nice product, but whoever packages your product should be more cArefull. I ordered the product in petit Nice product, but, whoever does the packaging needs to be more careful. Ordered a petit,which it said on the outside label,but once I opened the bag I found that it was definitely a regular length.  To be fair I didn‚Äôt contact the vendor, who probably would have said send them back. Too much hassle of that I must stress that the product is great nice soft material. It‚Äôs really too bad."
3.0,"Soft, snug, pill easily I normally wear about a size 6.  I ordered a small.  These were snug, but I feel like a medium would be too loose.  They also pill easily.  On the plus side, they are very soft."
3.0,"Need to be sure and read all of the description. The pants wear well.  I just didn‚Äôt read the ‚Äúpetite‚Äù part.  I didn‚Äôt return , because it was too much trouble."
3.0,Size isn‚Äôt what I thought I ordered. Be careful The pants are too long and are above my waist. Not really what I was looking for but ok for the price.
3.0,WATCH YOUR WAISTLINE! Perfect except for the stretched-out waistline (when brand-new!)
3.0,"Too long Fits comfortably, just too long"
3.0,"Size and length It's a medium and the waist was too big, I think the elastic in the waist need to be where it can stretch by itself."
3.0,Go down a size I bought this for my mom for Christmas and she usually wears a large in pants and shirts. This fits like an extra large. I would definitely go down a size.
3.0,HUGE. Loved the pant but so big I can't even keep them on... they literally fell to the floor.  Maybe a small?
3.0,"It runs large I am 200 pounds and 5'3"" and xl was huge. It falls off. Material is warm perfect for Southern California weather."
3.0,"Medium way too large The pants, material, quality was fine. The size, however, is way off. The medium fit more like an extra large!!  I ended up giving them away to another family member."
3.0,"Way too big The color was much different than what a expected, but still pretty. However, these pants were HUGE on me. Like, they would fall off if not holding them up. I‚Äôm usually a S/M, I went with the M based on measurements. Definitely the wrong choice."
3.0,"Go down 1-2 sizes Man, I got a small and they‚Äôre still too large!!! They were $5 so I‚Äôm not to disappointed.Edit: They‚Äôre actually not that large! Just a tad larger than I wanted, but they‚Äôre nearly a perfect fit. Just go down 1-2 sizes. But if you‚Äôre really tiny, they don‚Äôt have a small enough size for you."
3.0,The fit was not right for me. The quality was good for the price.  I gave them to my niece.  She was happy.
3.0,"Get 1 size smaller Very soft, but the legs are  wide and the waist is loose....I ordered a medium and should have a small...It doesnt shrink in the wash......."
3.0,"Comfy and cheap, but the sizes are waaaay off These pants run HUGE. Like, not even close. Usually I buy an XL to have roomy, comfy sweats, but I read that these run large, so I ordered a size Large instead of an XL. I can barely keep them up. They are still way too big."
3.0,Be aware of sizing. Great pants. I wear a 6 so ordered med. Don't like to tight. They were to big should have gotten small. Material is wonderful. Will order again but small.
3.0,Would be nice if not defective These are defective and I didn‚Äôt realize it until I had washed them. One leg is much shorter than the other. I use them to sleep in.
3.0,"Not consistent in sizing. I had order this before and it fit perfectly the second one same size is bigger, but after washing in hot water has shrunk a little."
3.0,"NO pockets My mistake in ordering sweats with no pockets. They are comfortable and price was good. A bit heavy for summertime and will be great in cool weather. Pockets are nice for keys, cell phone, iPod, chapstick, doggy poop bags."
3.0,"What's the draw(string)? O ordered larger than my true size because I thought they had a drawstring, but it's just an elastic waistband. Disappointed,  but that's my fault for assuming."
3.0,"Perhaps a little too basic All my pants in the same size either fit me perfectly or are a bit too tight. These are almost falling off me, and there's no drawstring. There also are no pockets. However, they are comfortably warm and don't look likely to wear out too fast. If they actually fit, I'd be pretty satisfied. As it is, I'll use them but I'm glad they were only $4."
3.0,"Run big I am 5‚Äù these pants are about 5 inches too long for my length. They are also very big! I ordered a medium, and definitely needed a small."
3.0,"Nice pants Nice pants, but even in petite, they are way too long. I'm 5'0"" with an inseam of 28 ""....Still 4 "" too long for me."
3.0,Love them but too big I ordered a medium and they are too big.  I love them as they are so comfy but too big!
3.0,Way too big Absolutely gigantic. They said they were large. I could fit two of me in the pants. I will be ordering in a way smaller size
3.0,The are warm They were pants
3.0,Comfortable I liked how soft they are on the inside. Very comfortable. More bell bottomed and wide at the bottom than how they looked in the photo.
3.0,"Too long for me Really like this item but gave it to my daughter because it was too long. Would you order short if available.  I'm 5'5"""
3.0,Long and Long I bought a medium pair and they are LONG and the waist is NOT that big around... You need to be LONG and Leanish to wear these.
3.0,Fit and quality Waiting to reorder after washing.  Was  a little large and will see if they will shrink.  Very satisfied with quality of item.
3.0,SIZES are huge! They are huge!!! I tried the medium and then the small and still HUGE!!!!
3.0,"Too long, and too wide at bottom Nice material, legs too long and too wide at the bottom"
3.0,"Fabric change After a few washings, the fabric started to get weird. These are thick which is great for lounging not for working out. There are no pockets."
3.0,Color  not true  as shown Ordered  Slate  heather ..  a gray .  Color not true.  Checked the # and  O.K.  but  definetly  is a  navy  blue .
3.0,"Hanes Eco Smaht, runs huge compared to other Hanes Loungers, for sure"
3.0,Open holes Pants had some tiers and small openings on legs I had to sew them by hand.
3.0,Hanes ecosmart sweat pants. The pants are thinner than I expected for a sweatpant.  They also were low rise.  Do not advise for women size.
3.0,"Too long for someone short I love the pants, although no pockets. I was disappointed that I didn‚Äôt see it in petite. I needed large but I didn‚Äôt see where they came in petite."
3.0,Runs Large I ordered a large and should have ordered medium. They are too big and too long in the legs. Think medium would have worked. Nice fabric.
3.0,Longer than most will have to him good price but kind of poor quality and way too long. I got these for my mom who is 5 foot 5 and they're about 3 in too long
3.0,Order smaller than you normal size!! Ordered my normal size and had to double check when I opened them.  I really thought I had accidentally ordered 2 sizes bigger.  Sending back and ordering smaller.
3.0,"No pockets These are awesome pants, nice feel, looks more expensive than they are, I ordered 3 pairs. They will be sent back, however, I didn‚Äôt notice they had no pockets. :("
3.0,Nice feel but ran really large. Had to return Just way too big.
3.0,"These run large. Order a size smaller These run large. Order a size smaller than you normally wear. There is not a tie string, just elastic waist, that runs large also."
3.0,"I ordered large, description said it came with drawstring but it did not. Will order medium now. Misinformation...no drawstring"
3.0,"Nice quality Even though the sweat pants are nice quality,  but runs big. I am a size 14 and purchased an extra large just for a loose fit but they are really big."
3.0,About right for the price I was disappointed.expected a somewhat better quality length was perfect stitching was horrible elastic in waist well there wasn't any
3.0,Nice pants but very hot Nice pants but too hot for me to wear maybe if I were up north in the winter.
3.0,"I am tall..these are long! The fit was loose around the waist, but the real issue here is the length. Quite long. I have not washed them yet, not sure if they‚Äôll shrink. Fine for my purpose, quarantine lounging."
3.0,Big fit! The pant is big not so big though. I‚Äôm a 26 in waist and the small size pant still had space in it
3.0,"Too Long The length was too long. I like the quality, not too thick, not too thin.  Very comfortable, just too long."
3.0,"Suggest sizing down... The vanity sizing on this product is wild. I'm 5'3"", 140 lbs, typically a size 6. Ordered a M and they barely stay on my hips. They're huge."
3.0,"Legs too long for a petite size I like the fit. The size I ordered was suppose to be a petite small. The legs runs too long. Had to fold the hem 2""."
3.0,"Huge! Size down. The pants are thick, but enormous. Size way down. I got a medium (usually wear medium or large) and they barely stay up."
3.0,Too long no Very long
3.0,"Ugly I'm 76 , and this style is to old for me . OK to feed the chickens in. Will not buy again ."
3.0,"Comfortable, but really big These pants are soft and would be very comfortable if they weren‚Äôt so large. I ordered a small (which is my normal size) and they barely stay on my hips. Had I not thrown everything away upon arrival, I‚Äôd be returning them."
3.0,"Snug in the Rear Too snug in the booty... I usually go Medium/Large with bottoms but I went Medium based on reviews. If you've got some booty, don't size down or you'll be sorry."
3.0,Good value but runs very large. Nice fabric but I had to take the waist in about 2 inches.  Would buy again but one size smaller!
3.0,TTS I saw a ton of reviews that the fit was larger so when I purchased them I sized down. They fit but I should have got my normal size.
3.0,I ordered petite length and they are  too long petite length too long
3.0,Runs VERY Large and no drawstring These were nice oants for me to wear afteri havebirth but they run really large.  There is no drawstring so i dont thi k i.will be able to wamear long term.  The weird thing is the top I bought with it runs small (very short)
3.0,"Comfort Great for lounging, very comfy and soft material. Too long I had to cut it to the right length. It runs big, should have gotten a XS."
3.0,Run big. Just too long especially at bottom of the pants.Very comfy. Very warm. Good to wear around the house but not out.
3.0,Poorly sewn Product fit fine but both the blue and the gray came with little tears in the seam
3.0,"Elastic waist band, no elasticity These sweat pants are cut very large for the size, even too baggy for sweats. But, that would be ok if the built in elastic actually was not so loose. The elastic has zero bounce back in it, as if it was baked in the dryer once too often.  I double over the waistband so the pants don‚Äôt fall off. Using for pjs only. Glad the price was so low."
3.0,Runs large These were very large. I ordered a medium and they could be considered and extra large
3.0,Legs are extra wide The pants legs are very wide. From the crouch all the was down. Looks and feels ridiculous.
3.0,I went by Amazon suggested size that I should order and it was way too small. I went by Amazon suggested size that I should order and it was way too small.
3.0,runs waaaay big ended up giving them to my husband they were so large but the quality of material is good for the price
3.0,Way too wide at bottom They fit pretty well other than the legs are way too wide at the bottom...you can trip over the extra material!
3.0,Comfy Comfy but to big..
3.0,"Not so perfect Nice material,  but to long, all three pair were ordered the same size, but one was bigger then the rest"
3.0,"uneven pant leg length Well, I love the pants but I wish the legs were the same length.  I will keep and maybe cut into shorts when the weather warms up.  Oh well."
3.0,"Ok for the price They are thicker than expected, and very big in the legs. I only wear these in the house to lounge.They run larger than expected."
3.0,Fit Comfortable but fit is strange.high in front but low over butt. Not meant if you have an ample butt lol. I like them still
3.0,Too Long For Many These are very long. Def for those 5‚Äô6‚Äù at least and taller
3.0,"Waistband way to big I usually wear size M but the waistband is way to big! The pants are also too long, but very nice quality"
3.0,true to size except the length very long i like them although they are toooo long didnt see petite in the ordering page. i would of ordered the shorter ones sweat shirts are fine i like them long and lose.
3.0,Not petite These were supposed to be petite but they are super long.
3.0,"Too long Like the material but these pants are too long for me ( I'm 5'1"") and too big. For the price tho, it's not worth returning."
3.0,reasonable but way large reasonable for the price but runs large.  I am a petite/small and they are being returned as way large.
3.0,"Good quality material. Too large around the waist. Too long in the length. I should have looked for an petite length, but I didn't see on."

3.0,"Waist band too big. I like these pants, but as others stated waist band was huge.  Legs fit nice and good length.  Had to roll waist band down to keep them from falling."
3.0,Fit larger than expected I ordered the XL but when opened the package they looked like they could be 2xl they look large. Material very comfortableNext time I will buy the Large
3.0,"Wrong size I received the men's size. Have worn anyway, but way too big."
3.0,"I obviously did not read the details. I prefer pants on the waist. Price was great, but I won't order again because I need pants to fit at the waist."
3.0,Runs big The pant legs around are huge  had to sew them as I was tripping on the bell bottoms....took them in 3 inches...now they are great sleeping sweats.
3.0,Not What I Expected I ordered two sizes down and these were still too big. They are bootcut and loose and billowy to the point they look very sloppy.
3.0,Runs large and short in length These pants run very large. I ordered a women‚Äôs small and it fit like a women‚Äôs XL
3.0,"Shrink in length Very comfy, however after 1 wash they shrunk in length considerably and now I can‚Äôt wear them anymore because they look ridiculous."
3.0,"Good pants, but too long. Great pants! Quality made. Thought they were petite..fit well in waist, thighs, and hips....much longer than expected.."
3.0,"Too thick,too warm The pants were okay but way too thick for my liking.They are made well but I live in Florida and unless there is a drop of temperature (under 30 degrees ) I don't think I'll be wearing them"
3.0,"One leg longer than the other Nice to the touch, comfy and warm, However one leg is longer than the other. It is very noticeable."
3.0,"Good Value For the money you can't go wrong. Fits and feels good. Only washed them once, so not sure how they will hold up long term."
3.0,"Runs a bit large They run a little big in the hip/waist. However, they are working really well as maternity pants. They will definitely fit through my entire 2nd and 3rd trimester."
3.0,They may vary in size They are a lot bigger than the first pair I got of the same size a few weeks ago
3.0,Basic sweatpants The front waistband part was long and the back was weird. If you have a big butt I do not recomend.  Seriously though. They were soft and basic sweatpants otherwise.  Good deal for the price.
3.0,"Sizing is wrong Ordered a small petite, pants were too big, were more like a large in size especially at the waist."
3.0,the sizes run big. ordered 2x petite....way too long but hopefully it will shrink. suggest ordering 1 size smaller than normally.

3.0,They are very warm. Runs large. Good for cooler weather.
3.0,Comfy Very comfortable. Loose & baggy. Nice for around the house but I wouldn‚Äôt wear them out
3.0,I would buy this product if petite size avaiable I need size small web site did not offer small size.
3.0,Size too big this item was too large and has no drawstring to tighten them.  I did like the color!
3.0,Ok The pant leg is too long. I wanted a petite but there was no way to select that on Amazon.
3.0,Size larger than expected Fit was bigger than expected; had to roll the waistline but got for lounging around so not horrible.
3.0,"Way too long. Nice pants however i ordered this item in petite as i am just slightly over 5'1"" and they are 5"" too long."
3.0,Disappointed. It was too tight for the XL size.  Gave it to my DIL
3.0,Decent quality fitzwell but wanted a heavier pair of sweatpants This pair of Hanes sweatpants are much lighter than the previous pair I purchased. Was looking for the one that has the soft cotton lining inside
3.0,"Decent for the price.  Runs big Runs a bit big, but still comfortable.  BUT after one day, the fabric is already starting to pill  on the insides of the legs.  But what can you expect for $7."
3.0,COMFORT PLUS really large.  And baggy.  and warm too.  None of that is a bad thing.  Just not fashionable.
3.0,"Go up a size. The length was just right, but a bit tight around the waist.  I should have gone a size bigger."
3.0,Soft but very large These pants are soft and comfy but the size runs very large. I had to hem them & the waist is loose.
3.0,Pill easily My thighs rub together and these pilled very badly after only a couple wears. Not very durable and will likely tear in the next couple wears
3.0,too big i tried siize med too large liked the pants ordered a size small still way too big
3.0,Way way loose! Super baggy on waist. No drawstring.  Fits fine in the tush.
3.0,OK product5 extremely wide legs. good for lounging inside. Would not go outside with them on
3.0,Hanes Sweatpants Ordered medium regular length.  Length too long but acceptable.  Good value for the money.
3.0,Not true to size. They are huge.  The size is all wrong.
3.0,Quality ok. Runs very largevv
3.0,these run large order a size or 2 smaller!  I did keep mine as I am having knee surgery and the extra room in the knee will be handy and as the cost was minimal even if I only wear them a handful of times I'm not out anything!
3.0,"Look and comfort was good. Length was just right, waist was a little big, but overall very warm and comfortable."
3.0,Runs large The medium was too large; I've taken medium for decades; this was a surprise and a let down.
3.0,"Nice pant - but BIG These are nice, soft pants but; I followed sizing guidelines and the pants were way too big. I am returning for a smaller size."
3.0,"Light grey runs big This is our go-to brand for lounge wear. We‚Äôve purchased 3 pairs of the same size but different colors in the past few months but the light grey, though they say are the same size (ordered all in size Large), are easily a size bigger than the tag reads."
3.0,I little too big Pant length is good a bit long but I like sweat pants like that. The elastic isn‚Äôt as strong and they are wide at the hips
3.0,"Ok These sweats are very basic.  Straight leg, soft, wider at the ankle.  They do run long."
3.0,Run pretty big These fit very large. Like not-stay-up when ordering normal size large. So be cautious of that.
3.0,Fit and weight The fabric is a little  heavier than I expected although for cold winter nights in Maine its been fine.  Definitely get a size below what you normally get.  I am always a large but got the medium which is still a bit loose.
3.0,These pants SHED They run big which isn‚Äôt an issue as much as it is good info.  The only bad thing is the amount of fuzz that comes off of them.  For $7.50 I‚Äôd expect nothing less.
3.0,"Ecosmart Sweatpant They are what I expected.  I intend to wear them in the fall.  I do not think they will be warm enough for winter ware,"
3.0,Size down!! I‚Äôm swimming in these. I ordered a Med I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7 150lbs and the Mrs is HUGE. They look like clown pants.
3.0,"Baggy sweats. These pants must have been tagged wrong. Way too big, long, and loose. But I was able to regift them!"
3.0,Size Bought my normal size and the pants run quite large. i would suggest buying a smaller size as I have washed and dried them with no noticeable shrinking
3.0,Fit was all wrong The legs were way long. Material was lighter than I expected
3.0,"I Really Hate These Pants I hate these pants. I have a curvy figure with a waistline, and I cannot keep these pants up. They slide down, making them so long I am afraid I will trip on them. And yet, they are not too large. These should be marketed for men."
3.0,Order a size down Order a size down.  Nice fabric- too big at waist and length
3.0,Very nice Very nice but a little to big I ordered a large but a medium size would have been better I will be reordering
3.0,Medium too wide in legs and petite too long Doesn‚Äôt fit well. Ordered petite.  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô1 and they‚Äôre way too long.  Legs are very baggy.
3.0,Seem nice but runs extremely large Extremely large...I normally wear a large in pants & in Jean's depending on brand size 9 or 10/11 and purchased a large... way to big... seemed as if they were a XXL... had to return.
3.0,Watch your sizing! These pants were way too big! Definitely should have ordered down a size. After a wash cycle they shrug a bit causing them to fit better but I am concerned for future washes. Despite the fit they are definitely warm and comfortable.
3.0,"Great price I tried them on but had to return because it fit weird in my body. I have a large bum, so it barely covered."
3.0,"Just okay The fabric is cheaper than I expected from Hanes, not very soft and really attracts pet hair. But I only paid $7 for them so ok.  They also fit looser than I expected so I keep having to pull them up.  Maybe that‚Äôs my fault, perhaps I should‚Äôve gotten a small."
3.0,For taller ladies These were not flattering on me. To long. I am short. If you are taller good to go
3.0,"Love them, if only they fit better Very comfy just needed to order a size smaller as they fit very large so not true to my usual size I buy."
3.0,Runs pretty large I'm only returning my XL pants because they run pretty big. The quality is very good.
3.0,Comfy but big and long size down!! Way to long and and when washed fuzzies everywhere definitely could of sized down but sweat pants are comfy !!
3.0,"Runs big These ran too big for me.  Otherwise, they seemed nice and comfortable."
3.0,Cozy and comfortable Very comfortable and cozy. Sizes run larger than expected and a bit long for me. Otherwise it launders well and keeps it's shape.
3.0,"ORDER A SIZE DOWN These are GIGANTIC around the waist. Hoping they shrink. I usually wear a medium, which is what I ordered and they are falling off my behind."
3.0,Runs Big They run big no kidding I‚Äôm a 12-14 got xl it‚Äôs it swam on me
3.0,"XL is Huge I'm 5'9"" 200 lbs and XL was huge.  Too big and long for husband at 6'2"" 200 lbs.  Material Ok."
3.0,Bought a small for my daughter and it was HUGE Sizing is way off.  Should make an XS if the small is going to be huge.
3.0,They look great and are very comfortable wish they fit my waist. Unfortunately when I received my order I lose weight so the plants were too big for my waist.
3.0,Needed a petit length Did not fit me at all but did fit my daughter and she loves these. Especially the wide band at top.
3.0,"If you don't like fleece material these pants won't work. I thought I was ordering cotton. It's cotton on the outside, but covered with fleece on the inside. I'm not a fan of fleece at all. The pants seem to run big as well and a little longer than expected. I wouldn't repurchase."
3.0,The sizing was way off The pants though nice the sizing was incorrect.
3.0,Hanes leisure pants I liked the material. It was soft to the touch and feels good.  However the pants are too large. I wear a size 4 and these are more like an 8. If you are a petite order an extra small if possible.
3.0,Be careful with size It is comfortable but the size is too large
3.0,Weird Cut Too big all o we with a too short rise in the crotch.
3.0,Not what I expected. I always get medium and these were huge. I also thought they had pockets and they didn't I did a return.
3.0,"Runs big!!!  Order down a size These pants run really large!!  I exchanged my original large for a medium, and the medium is still quite large üò≤"
3.0,Waist runs large Soft and comfy but the waist is way too big):
3.0,Too long Wish they had a petite and pockets would have been good
3.0,"Price is fine but do not fit as should The price is fine, but these were supposed to be size medium, and more of an extra large in size, i will keep as too much trouble to send back. The quality is ok and these are priced right, but should not be an add on item,they should be priced regular item."
3.0,not to size I didn't  like the way they fit.  too loose.
3.0,Not straight legs Bottom of legs are bell bottoms.  I‚Äôm going to take them in to be straight leg.
3.0,"These run small I bought 2 pair of these, both in size large, and both run about a size to a size + 1/2 small."

3.0,Order smaller size I love that it was soft and comfy but sizing was way to big
3.0,Just ok. They don‚Äôt feel right in the rise. Seems too short.
3.0,Average Like Going down one size is a must. I wish the legs tapered alittle. I feel like I'm wearing bell bottoms.
3.0,"Tight waist. Plenty of space everywhere except waist. Waist measured 32"" and only stretched to 33"". Ordered a L due to previous reviewers reporting ""larger than expected"" which would have been fine except tight in the waist. These might be ""seconds"" so there is no telling...."
3.0,"Way too big These run really really large. Most of my smalls have been snug lately, but these pants are enormous on me and don't stay up. I know I didn't lose a ton of weight overnight, so the pants are obviously poorly sized. If I were to order again (which I won't), is get an xxs in hopes they'll fit like a small."
3.0,"These are too long Order size smaller, these legs are too long.  But they are comfortable."
3.0,Need pockets I just wish the ads pockets to women‚Äôs pant . We don‚Äôt always carry a purse !!
3.0,"They'd be fine if your body type is large hips and a ... A little baggy overall and lose at the waist.  I generally need the extra hip room, so went for a large, but I need a waist band that keeps it in place.  They'd be fine if your body type is large hips and a large waist.  The Champion brand fit much better for the girl with curves, also size lg."
3.0,"Very Basic Got a hole in one of the seams within a week of wearing. Plus, no pockets..."
3.0,grande la tela es agradable pero la descripci√≥n de la talla no ayuda a elegir de manera correcta
3.0,"Runs very big, and bottom of legs are extremely wide Good comfy fabric, the only reason for the low stars is that the pants run VERY big, and the bottom of the legs are extremely wide, the fit is very off, it's ashame because the fabric is very soft and cozy"
3.0,Sad I can wear it Disappointed way to big
3.0,Sweatpants Comfy but which the legs were linger.  I‚Äôm only 5‚Äô6.5.  Not that tall.
3.0,"I'm hilarious so read this. All is friggin awesome except they pill like a son of a gun. Seriously, my house will be covered for weeks but then they stop.At least you could have another excuse to vacuum! (Not a great slogan for sweat pants, Hanes.)"

3.0,Order one size smaller Says 8/10. But more like 1416.
3.0,Cheap Pants It was a terrible material- it has black fuzz coming out after the first wash.
3.0,Comfort Like price and very comfortableDislike they aren't very stretchy and no pockets.

3.0,"Too big but works better after you wash and dry These were definitely too big upon arrival but after washing and drying, they fit much better.  I just wear these around the house so they aren't a fashion statement or anything.  They're nice and soft and warm."
3.0,Liked and Disliked Like the comfort. Dislike it not having pockets nor waist draw cord.
3.0,"Not made in USA - sizes run small Made in Bangladesh (south Asia), so size medium is a size small by US standards."
3.0,Item runs large in size Quality seemed decent but sizing was wayyy to big
3.0,customer service is really good. they really work with you this company is awesome in customer service  I loved the softness the sweatpants i just didn't realize how big the bottom of the legs were  and how small they ran.  If I could get it the right size for me and especially more tailored legs i would get it  yes I recommend  it
3.0,Order a size smaller than your sweats that fit. Way too long without elastic at bottom of legs. Also made bigger all over. I'd normally order inexpensive sweats in an X-Large to allow for shrinkage. I saw the % of people who said they run larger so I ordered a size L.I sure HOPE the L shrinks  .I need sweats too bad to return them & will not wear these out of the house.
3.0,Very large I sized down one size as recommended and these were still too large in the waist and too long. Had to send back.
3.0,Baggier than I thought Little baggy and warmer material than I would like
3.0,Runs big I didn't try on- it truly runs large
3.0,Not the best Bigger than normal adult medium and pill a lot I only washed twice.
3.0,Comfy and good value These are very comfortable and soft on the inside. But there was a small hole in the crotch. I guess I‚Äôll have to take some time to sew it up.
3.0,"No era la talla El pantal√≥n era talla M y no corresponde a las medidas promedio de esa talla , creo que era demasiado grande para  ser M"
3.0,Huge! These are nice fabric but huge. The pair I received are like a 3x. I washed and dried but are still like a 2x.. I ordered xl which should have fit but these fall down even when I turn the waist over and the legs are like elephant legs. Maybe they got the label wrong?
3.0,"Disappointed I was very disappointed with these sweat pants.  The fit was way off. The waist was much larger than the rest of the pant.  It was like it should have had elastic in the waist band but it was never put it.  I buy a lot of Hanes items & I'm usually satisfied with them,  but not this one."

3.0,"Shrinks in Wash Not high quality, shrank about 2"" in the wash."
3.0,Too big and baggy I went by the size chart way off too big. I had to take them in and put elastic in the waist jus so they didn‚Äôt fall down. Reminded me of old man pants.

3.0,"like myself, I chose the smaller of the two ... If you are in between sizes, like myself, I chose the smaller of the two because I knew that the lesser size would be slightly tight, but not tight enough to never wear it.

3.0,"just OK Not so much....somewhat just OK.  The idea is great, flat waistband (no tie) but that is the problem.  The waistband has little elasticity therefore it is pretty much the same at waist as at hips.  By rolling slightly solved the problem and will keep."
3.0,"Little larger than expected I normally order small, but this ""small"" is really large. I am 5'4"", 130# and they are big. No pockets or drawstring either. They also run a little short.

3.0,Three Stars The pants are supposed to be petite but are way too long.
3.0,Three Stars I nseam is shorter than I expected
3.0,Three Stars Sweatpants was too large so I end up giving it as a Christmas gift to someone
3.0,"Too short and very baggy I‚Äôm tall - 5‚Äô9‚Äù, so I read very carefully the comments about the length, hoping these would be long enough. I also studied the picture, and it appeared that these were a relatively slim fit. Unfortunately, they are too short and very baggy. They hit above my ankles and are too large in the legs, which gives a very goofy appearance. That‚Äôs OK because I‚Äôm only going to wear them around the house, but I had really hoped for a more flattering fit."
3.0,Three Stars Quality is good. But the small petite fits like a large.
3.0,Waist fits a little snug Lenght is great but waist is snug

3.0,"Too big Unfortunately these would have been the perfect sweats except that they are way too big.  I ordered a small and they were labeled small, but they were more like a large."
3.0,Too big but soft Tried them on and they‚Äôre definitely extra wide in the waist. Im tall as well so the pants are like capris on me. Haha. The plus side to this pair of extremely unflattering pants is that they‚Äôre very soft and comfortable
3.0,Three Stars The quality is good but the small fits like a large.
3.0,Not petite length Much too long. Definitely not petite

3.0,Runs too big runs too big
3.0,I like style but too big. Pants are too big. I like the design and color. Will exchange for smaller size. I recommend sizing down one size!
3.0,"These pants run VERY big.  Get at least 2sizes smaller. I wanted to have a pair of warm sweat pants for the winter months.  While the color was even prettier than in the picture and the fabric was so soft, the pants were very, very large!I would recommend getting 1-2 sizes smaller.I returned them."
3.0,"Large in the waist, no drawstring. These are very soft & comfortable except in the waist, and this is where I think a drawstring option would be important for this brand as the waist sizes seem to run large."
3.0,o.k. just to big
3.0,"Shrinks in wash. The material is very thin.  Bought the medium and it shrunk.  I am 5'4"" and they ended up too short.  Inseam is about 29"".  Fortunately, they fit someone else in the family.  I will now order a large and hope for the best."
3.0,Size is bigger than I expected This is not regular size. You must buy small size than your regular order.
3.0,Run very large They run too large
3.0,"Needed Petite at 5'4"" The pants were a nice weight and quality.  The price couldn't be beat!  I ordered these for my mother who has cancer so wants comfortable cloths to wear. She is 5'4"", 130 lbs. and normally wears a regular medium.  I got 4 pair in different colors. The pant legs were way too long for her.  Otherwise the pants fit.  I'm returning these and ordering a petite size.  She's 81 now and may have lost some of her height.  She didn't want to deal with just having the sweats altered to the length she needed.  So I'm returning these and ordering petites."
3.0,When i sit down my bumbum shows! Haha! Got medium. When i sit down my bumbum shows! Haha
3.0,"Sizing off. Ok, so ordered a large for my mother, as she wears that size in other sweats (5.6 ft and 160 lbs) but large when received was 4 inches wider at waist (44 inch waist) and 2 inches longer (32 inch inseam)than a previous purchase of these pants. The sizing was consistently off on all 3 pants ordered. Returned for medium and they fit fine (36 inch waist & 30 inch inseam). Recommend order top in large and bottoms in medium. Only other bummer is that pants don‚Äôt have pockets."
3.0,"Runs very large These pants are beautifully made, very soft, and I would've kept them but for one thing: they run VERY large. I did see in the reviews that many people commented that they ran large, but since I was planning to wear thermal underwear beneath them, I was glad to hear they were a bit large. I did not expect the hips and waist to be at least two to three sizes too large, though!  I ordered a size S, and even XS would have been too big. Bummer."
3.0,"better use the try before buy option I bought the medium size sweatpant based on other pants I am wearing. It arrives quickly, but it is way too big comparing to my other pants. I regret that I didn't choose the 'try before you buy' option. The cost is low, and it not worthy of returning. The best option now seems to be goodwill or giving to other friends."
3.0,3 stars 1/4 pairs were good I ordered 4 pairs of these pants and only 1 came perfect. 2 of the pairs had uneven seams and the fabric was very rough. The other pair came with holes in the seams and one pant leg longer than the other by 1 inch!  If you‚Äôre going to order make sure when you get them to check the pant legs
3.0,"Too big! Fits 35""~44"" waist Pants quality is quite good, soft and nice. However, these are just way too big. See the photos with measure tape; 1st photo is lay on flat, 2nd photo is when stretch. So this pants fits 35""~44"" waist (may fit 46""?)I returned these pants. Thank you amazon, I got full refund.*Update Jan30.2017* I didn't mention what size I bought. Those were Medium size."
3.0,"not for tall women Came to about my ankle, which would have been fine for 7 buck pants. But the waist was big, and the elastic poor... as in not really any spring to the waist. The rise was too short for me too (5' 10'' and 153 pounds). So back they went."
3.0,"Meh I thought they were going to be long from reading the reviews but they are NOT. They are right at the ankle and no drawstring to tighten so they are kinda loose, therefore Im always pulling them up. They are now lounge wear around the house."
3.0,"Runs large around the waist Way too large in waist. Fits everywhere else. Nice generous length. Wish they came with a draw string to be able to tighten them. I ordered another pair, in a different color, and those were just a tiny bit loose on the waist. Same size"
3.0,"As others have said, fit is large. Unwashed, waist on a size large was 38-39"".  After washing is shrank some, but still remains very large."
3.0,Too big They were a little bigger than I expected them to be. I was afraid if I ordered the smaller size they would be too tight but ordered what I thought would fit and they were too big. Its almost like I'm in between sizes.
3.0,in general OK This product is OK but runs 2 sizes up bigger.The waist band is nonexistent making them baggy in the waste line. Definitely quality control issue.
3.0,"Inaccurate Description I would not buy these pants again. The description did not mention they are very thick (like fleece inside). However, I am not returning them because they were only $7.50 and it's not worth the effort."
3.0,"Incorrect sizing..much larger than stated Sizing information is incorrect. I ordered a large wanted a bit of extra room for comfort.  The pants were super extra large, I could fit 2 of me in them."
3.0,Are these made for men?? These fit more for a man than a woman. The medium should not be this loose on me. Kind of sad. Guess I'll be gifting them to the hubz.
3.0,to hight  and to long it fits like xxl is to high and to large I will keep because I like the material and I will fixed and is good price .
3.0,Runs large These seem to be decent quality but they run large. I wear a six pant and the small was too big.
3.0,"Wrong length sent Ordered 4 pair (gift) in size medium petite length; happy with product except 2 were sent in regular length, so too long."
3.0,"These pants run very big! I normally get a large, but ordered a medium. Still too big. I would suggest ordering 2 sizes smaller."
3.0,"Sweatpants run large and long I ordered a large.  They are too big. They are also long.  I'm 5'5"" and these drag on the floor.  I washed and dried but they didnt shrink.  I use them for pajama pants."
3.0,Not long enough Pant legs were short. I don‚Äôt wear them because of it.
3.0,Too big WAY too big. Had to return for smaller size.
3.0,Gross! Sent stained and had pet hair or whiskers on them. Just yuck! No more Amazon clothes ever!
3.0,Way too large! Very large for a medium!
3.0,"Fits Very Large - Comfy to Wear I deliberately purchased this product in two sizes to compare them to previously purchased pants of the exact same type, directly from Hanes.  While these pants have the 'Hanes' label they are obviously mislabeled for size.  They are HUGE for the size tagged.  My other pair are mediums and fit me to size; they are a true medium.  This 'medium' fits more like a large or even extra large.  The large pair are obviously an XL or even 2X.  So, buyer beware - if you're going to order this product from Amazon, order AT LEAST one size smaller.  Better yet, order two pair - one size smaller and one two sizes smaller - and compare the two.Apart from miss-sizing, the product is solid.  Good fabric and construction and, in the correct size, fit nicely and wear well.  As with any fleece product they do bag at the knees and butt after being worn a while, but very comfy."
3.0,Good value Lounge around . During lockdown
3.0,"Wide waistband and correct length as expected... But the waist and hips are quite a bit too big for XL size ordered.  To me, this fits more like a 1X, and I can only hope it shrinks, as I won't be able to keep it from slipping down if it doesn't!!  It is a beautiful color that might get donated to a charity..."
3.0,Too large It runs very large.
3.0,Run BIG Even a size small was way too big!
3.0,Three Stars For my Mom...
3.0,It was way to big but I try to get ... It was way to big but I try to get more stuff from this  buyer... totally understood when I wanted to return it
3.0,"A large would have been fine. These sweatpants are a bit floppy After reading reviews I ordered extra large, and it's too big. A large would have been fine. These sweatpants are a bit floppy. The elastic waistband is a bit cheap looking, but then these were very inexpensive.  The fabric is thick and comfy, perfect for cold winter lounging."
3.0,Was a bit disappointed in this item Was a bit disappointed in this item.  The waistband was like something stretched out. It would have been better to run a string through it. Like the feel of the fabric but the waistband is suppose to be elastic but feels completely stretched out.
3.0,Not worth it Pretty cheap. Before I even wore them they ripped a small hole in the behind.
3.0,"They seem to run very big. They are very ... They seem to run very big. They are very warm which is what I ordered them for however, although I ordered a petite small I still need to have them hemmed and taken in."
3.0,"Look carefully Legs look tapered in photo, but are really wide at hem.  Otherwise as expected."
3.0,Three Stars They're nice for the price but two sizes too big.
3.0,"Too big These are really big in the waist. I'm 5'8"" and 130 lbs, usually wear a size 4 in pants, and the size small was WAY too big in the waist."
3.0,Three Stars It doesn't fit that I expected; It's todo big to me. I thing uno or two sices.
3.0,Three Stars Larger than expected. I would order a size smaller.  Also did not expect material to be so heavy/thick.
3.0,... are to big but other then that swaters are perfect I think I got to largePants are to big but other then that swaters are perfect
3.0,Three Stars I hope they shrink a bit in the wash
3.0,"Pretty good, but... The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†These pants are comfy, and have pockets that are usable. My only complaint is that they didn't hold up well as work pants, but I knew they wouldn't going in to it. Just wish they'd had a little more life in them. Holes have started and the material is getting thin."
3.0,"Priced right, touch long on legs. Kept her warm, vibrant color. Just a touch long for my gf (small size ordered), but they're just for lounging around at home so no big deal. Price is right."
3.0,Three Stars Pants are good but definantly one size to large
3.0,sending back.. should have ordered medium. sending back..should have ordered medium.
3.0,that such price and quality - I think I would ... that such price and quality - I think I would have paid for them $ 3 and can only 1.5 ((
3.0,"A good deal but, does run big. * Updated Review...read below.* Shipping was great. Only took 2 days to arrive after placing the order. I read the reviews and was cautious to order a size smaller than I'd usually wear. I am about 138 lbs and 5'2. However, I have a small waist and fuller thighs. So, I ordered a size small. Well, there is a lot of stretch in this material. I wish that there was a drawstring to tighten at the waist. As you sit throughout the day, the material stretches out and I have to roll it at the waist to keep from sagging down. These are long on me as well but me being short, it was already expected.  I wish that there were pockets but, no biggie. I also wish that an x-small was available because I think the fit would suit me better. Still a great price and hopefully these pants will shrink with washing.**Update**I bought three pairs of these pants in the grayish color, ebony, and purple. The purple one was way more stretched out and over sized than the others after the first wear. The gray and ebony fit similarly with some stretch. However, after the first wear the ebony pair had a whole in the leg within just a few hours after putting them on. I can stitch it up but, that is just ridiculous...not even one good wear out of them without an issue."
3.0,"Comfortable but not great if you have long legs I got these originally to wear for running short errands in town... They are comfortable, fit below the waist and are stretchy. However they are too short and tend to be high waters than going to the bottom of one's ankle. I have stretched them as much as I could to get them to the right length but they are still a little too short. The size is a little too big. So when I purchased the next size  smaller they fit better but was REALLY too short then. But they work alright for wearing around the house, but that's it."
3.0,"Nice pants, but odd fit Although I wanted to love these pants, they just don't fit the bill. I'm  a size 10, 5' 6"", 150 lbs., with a 32"" waist and ordered a large.First of all, they're overall just too large. The waist is too big and I keep having to hoist them up. Too bulky,  too long and they get caught under my heels. I would return them had I not taken off the tag.I kept thinking that I'd get used to them, but it's sort of a drag having to hoist them up all the time.I haven't washed them yet so perhaps that'll help."
3.0,"Weird fit Great price but the fit is a bit off. ‚Äú Petite‚Äù? Well, they are at least 3 inches too long and almost fit like ‚Äú low waisted‚Äù. I guess the inseam is a bit short. ( could‚Äôve used some of that extra length in the in seam).They arrives early, good packaging and although not super thick, they are thicker for winter use."
3.0,"Hit or Miss? I bought total 7 pairs in different colors. The fit and even the style is not identical for the same size pants.  They are definitely not created equal. I am 5‚Äô4‚Äù and 140 lbs with thin, long legs.  The petites are actually LONG so I need to fold them either at the waistband or bottom hem.  So if you are taller, should have no issues.  Some are wider than others and the elastic tightness at the waistband is also different.  I bought them to wear around the house so going to make ‚Äòem work.  Cheap!"
3.0,Pants not as fitting as expected I bought two colors of the same product.. the black one‚Äôs length was just right but the purple is a bit too long.. not sure why.. the fit at the waist is loose.. I bought a small and it‚Äôs still loose.. The thickness of it is good.. good for fall and even better for winter.. I washed them only once so far but didn‚Äôt notice any shrinking.. at least not anything that‚Äôs noticeable..
3.0,"So soft.. listen to the comments I absolutely love the feel of these pants... I just wish I listened to the comments about the size, and the suggestion said I should have bought a medium and I didn't listen(im usually an xl in pants) and bought a large.. still super big.. honestly wish I listened.. I'm still wearing these but  oh well"
3.0,"Sizing is off for this item I started with a large, and returned it because it was about 18 - 20 instead of 12 - 14.  So, I replaced it with a medium, which was true to 10 - 12 and too small.  Otherwise, the pants are great in fabric, softness, color, etc.  I‚Äôm keeping the medium and hoping to lose weight or stretch them out a bit."
3.0,A caveat to the sweats running large There is a flaw in the sizing between the mediums and the larges. After reading all the reviews I decided to order both medium and large sizes in the black and dark grey sweats. I‚Äôm between 5‚Äô5‚Äù and 5‚Äô6‚Äù and am curvier and typically wear size 9-11 Hollister jeans. Nearly everyone said the sweats run large but to play it safe I ordered both sizes. The mediums fit but are snug enough in the waist to fit like yoga pants. The larges are way too big. The larges fit more like an extra large. If you are between M/L sizes consider choosing another option.
3.0,"Too long and too flared I am 5 foot seven inches and I found the XL pants longer than I expected. Also, they were ver big and flared at the bottom.  They will be used for just around the house wear."
3.0,"So Comfortable! The first pair I bought was medium which is what I normally wear. They were a little big so I bought another pair size small that fit perfectly. In fact, I bought a couple more pairs. Since I work from home now, these are the only pants I‚Äôve worn around the house since last May. I just ordered more. So comfortable!"
3.0,"Order a smaller size than you normally wear. Based on other reviews, I ordered size small. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6, 138 lbs and the fit was loose. I washed them in warm water and then put them in the dryer hoping to shrink them but they are still loose. They are comfortable and will be fine for weekend lounging or errands."
3.0,"This item runs very LARGE for a medium size. Taking out of the package I thought they must have sent a XL or something. Checked the tag and it is the size I ordered, a medium, but they run very large.Wish they had a drawstring bc they are so big but I will add a snap or something bc I don't want to deal with returning an $11 pair of sweatpants.Nice color.Decent fabric."
3.0,Not a petite size The headline said ‚Äò#1 in petite athletic wear‚Äô so I ordered them assuming they were.  They are not.  They drag on the floor so I had to cut them with scissors and just keep them for around the house.Also note that they are low rise and do not go to your waist.
3.0,"The material was not great I mostly liked the pants, but the material is really scratchy and makes them hard to wear. They're nice pants but could be far more comfortable."
3.0,"Comfy These are comfy pants, but the waist and hip area is too large. Length is to ankle but I think they will shrink after I wash them. Great price, they will be good lounging around the house pants."
3.0,"Comfy but poorly made Very comfortable but...they shed white fuzz everywhere,  even after washing.  After first wash they developed a small hole in the seam of the crotch."
3.0,Runs Large I need 2 sizes smaller. I have purchased this item before and the size is unpredictable!
3.0,"Ebony color is not heatered like photo shows The photos used for the ""ebony"" colored pants appeared to be heathered in a charcoal or very dark grey color. It is not. They are a solid flat black."
3.0,Legs were too long and couldn't order petite here.  Should have kept looking. Basic size was OK but the length was 2 inches long.  I couldn't figure out how to order petite.  Petites can be ordered elsewhere on Amazon.
3.0,"Runs Big in the waist order one size down Should have listened and order one size down... right now they keep sliding down.. for the money they are a good value, just order one size smaller"
3.0,Size runs large so order down These run very large. I swim in the size that normally fits. Order a size down. The material and quality were fine
3.0,"Warm and comfy but too big I have been using these pant for about months and here is what I think:Pros: warm and comfy and good for the price.Cons: too large. I usually wear size 4 in jeans and I order the size S petit. Still too loose on the waist and too long (but it‚Äôs not like I can‚Äôt walk in them).I wish these had pockets, but can‚Äôt complain since the description didn‚Äôt say otherwise."
3.0,"Too big for me The pants are a great length and fit comfortably around the thigh, but are far too loose are the waist. Sizing definitely runs large"
3.0,"Order a size down. I wish i had read all reviews before ordering three!!  Runs big!!  With no pockets or drawstrings,  nor sure I can wear these."
3.0,Fit everywhere except the back They fit but they are definitely  not ‚Äújunk in the trunk‚Äù friendly.  In the rear they do not come to my waistline.  I brought a 2X.
3.0,Okay I wish they were longer. I don't wear tall pants but these i would have to.
3.0,Fit on the large side Warm and comfortable but don‚Äôt hold up. Legs are too baggy.
3.0,Too large I ordered a small .. these fit like a large LOL I was definitely confused
3.0,"It‚Äôs ok I bought the medium size but it was too big and I didn‚Äôt like it. Every time I buy a medium it‚Äôs perfect but this pair of pants were to long. But the material was very comfortable and warm. Overall these pair of pants were too long, but they were comfortable."
3.0,Good. Not great. Ordered a 2xl and it fits well at the waist over my pregnant belly. But the legs are HUGE. It‚Äôs comfy but could be a better fit.
3.0,"Comfy, fit is too large These are comfortable but definitely fit very large."
3.0,No drawstring These pants are comfortable but they don‚Äôt have a drawstring so it gets very loose so either I would just have to get a smaller size or don‚Äôt order it at all!
3.0,More like men‚Äôs medium Runs very big
3.0,It's ok A little big at waist but it's ok.
3.0,Opened package Exactly what I wanted but package came completely openedü§¨
3.0,Nice Wish it had a draw string but comfy pants!
3.0,Size Down Sister! Very big! Size down- maybe two sizes
3.0,Runs big Very long
3.0,Too Large These pants run liitle bit longer and bigger but worth for the price
3.0,Feel great but run large Feel soft and warm as expected but they are too large.  Order a size down.
3.0,Nothing It‚Äôs  ok
3.0,Sweats Amazon recommended a size and they were way to big.
3.0,Bad fit These are too low and small in the back and the legs are too wide I returned them not a good fit
3.0,"runs big I bought these in an XL thinking if they shrunk they'd be just right. Wrong. There is no draw string to tighten them, so whatever the waist is (which is huge on these pants) is what it is. I had to use safety pins on both sides of the pants to bring in about 2"" and then could still just pull down without undoing the safety pins."
3.0,"Were sent X-Largo not Large! I ordered both, the slate and black, for they look really comfy in a large, thinking they'll shrink.  Was sent X-large and they are HUGE!!!!  No idea who was doing the pick and pack here for these.  I washed them wishfully thinking because they are cotton they would shrink a bunch. NOPE.  Going to donate for someone who might need them."
3.0,"Nice Fabric These active wear/sweat pants are a nice material made of recycled materials.  It doesn't shrink and fade like traditional cotton fleece.  They run a bit large so keep that in mind.  I like clothes loose so I ordered a large.  It fit like an XL so I returned it for M, which was too small.  I reordered a 3rd time for a L and it fit finally.  It was worth the hassle!!  Nice wide comfortable waistband. I've been buying this fabric sweat shirts for years and it really holds up!"
3.0,"Well...they were like $7 so... Pros: the costCons: they are too big which isn't the worst thing, but even though they are big in my waist and length, they are still tight at my thighs.Huge con: I know I searched amazon for sweat pants pockets and these came up.
