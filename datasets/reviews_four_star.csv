4.0,"Comfortable Sweatpants I live in an area with cold, snowy winters so most of my time in sweats, inside the house.  I ordered these sweatpants to replace some older threadbare ones that I had worn forever.  I usually order an XL because I like them to be loose and comfortable.  These run large, even after washing and drying them twice.  The fabric is warm and cozy.  There are no pockets or drawstring, so there is no way to tighten them up around the waist.  They are long enough for me.  (32"" inseam).  I would order these again, but I would order a smaller size next time."
4.0,"Super comfy! These pants are really comfy! They ran a little long for me (5'5"") but otherwise a perfect fit and so comfy. Just wish they had pockets."
4.0,"Very warm and comfy, look good, but short in the waist and ripped. I went to a job interview in these!  Mind, it was not for a fully professional job, but when I asked if ""These pants would work?"" (*after* they had specifically outlawed sweatpants from the ""List 'o Acceptable Attire"") I was told ""Those are perfect"" üòÖ  They are soft, comfy, go everywhere and warm.  Now the bad part:  I ordered a medium, and they were too small.  Not in the waist!  I am a size 14, and Amazon recommended medium, so I went with medium.  And, yes, the elastic waist was fine, and so was the leg length.  But they were too short ""in"" the waist.  I kept having to hoist them back up, and I don't like that feel at all.  And the constant stretching of them meant I had a dime sized hole right in the middle of the crotch within two weeks and they had to be tossed.  (I guess I could have returned them.)  I'll re-order in large.  I did order the Hanes ""snug around the ankle"" large and that fit well.  So hopefully so will these.  Just be warned."
4.0,"Good basic pants I bought these for some PT I need.  As others suggested, I chose the ‚ÄòM‚Äô size since I take a petite M in Lands End stretchy jeans. These fit a bit snug in the butt, but otherwise are fine. Also a wee bit long on my 5‚Äô3‚Äù body, but with thick soles shoes they are fine.  Wash and dry easily,malthough there‚Äôs a lot‚Ä¶a LOT! ‚Äî of lint.  My lint trap was full the first time washed, and still nearly full the second time."
4.0,"Size Down I'm a 29""-30"" pants size. Typically size US size 8 pants. The medium was too big. Also, no pockets."
4.0,Not my favorite but ok The pants run large. I kept them for wearing in the house on cold nights. I would not wear them in public
4.0,"The fit was perfect The legs were like huge bell bottoms pants.Won‚Äôt wear out in public, but will wear at home."
4.0,Sweatpants Good fit. Wish they had elastic around the ankles and pockets.
4.0,"Great Basic Item for the Price For less than $15 these are great. Comfortable, mid rise waist, no pockets. I do recommend buying a size down -- I'm usually an XL or XXL but the large fits me well without being snug. Length is great for someone 5'8""."
4.0,"Needs drawstring I‚Äôm a caregiver for ex, needs a drawstring to keep up. Would be alright if could stay up!!"
4.0,Good Pants Wife likes them. They stayed soft through a few washes. Pretty durable.
4.0,Comfortable Only drawback is no pockets
4.0,"Just ok. These sweatpants are just OK for the money. They are very soft and comfortable, but don‚Äôt have any pockets, which is very inconvenient. They are also starting to pill and wear in the thigh area, so I am not convinced that they are going to last very long."
4.0,"Not perfect, but good for the price Material is lighter weight than the usual sweatpants fleece, but it's soft and comfortable. Hems and seams are well finished. The wide, covered elastic waistband is comfortable. No pockets, but for this price, that's not too much of a drawback. Hanes garments usually stand up well to wear and washing, but I'll post an update if they get baggy or if the brushed inside of the fabric ""pills"" excessively."
4.0,Nice They fit and are warm
4.0,Very Long Will have to hem these.  I am 5'2 and these are very long.  Fairly thick also but will work for going to physical therapy in winter.
4.0,"Low waist, barely long enough They seem to be decent quality but the waist is low so they didn‚Äôt stay up well, and the legs were wide but barely long enough. They were fine for a Halloween costume but would drive me bonkers if I had to keep hiking them up all day."
4.0,Over Size The material is good but the size is too big. I‚Äôm small or medium can work sometimes but this fits like XL.
4.0,"Quality, pattern and cost effective purchase. Like the weight in this cold weather but don't like the no-pockets!No fault of Amazon, I need to read the blurps more thoroughly."
4.0,"They run large; order next size down. I love that they're 40% recycled plastic bottles yet feel  like regular sweats. They are great for transitional weather or chilly times (as in SoCal, say mid to low 60s) but not necessarily for very cold weather (like in the 40s)."
4.0,Feel great. Wish there was a short. Way to long for me.
4.0,Made for comfort This purchase was bought by size guide. These sweats run large. Do not run true to size. Suggest to down size. Very roomy cut will definitely fit a ampule figure. I purchase a medium should have got a small.
4.0,"Comfortable sweats Great pants for the price, runs alittle big.I bought a large, I will size down next time."
4.0,Hanes sweat pants It feels really good the only thing I wish that it could be a little more tapered from the knee down ‚Ä¶
4.0,"Size issue I kept these because I only wear them around the house for comfort and warmth. The problem is I bought 4 pair at the same time and every pair fit differently. These are the kind I usually buy but normally I just buy them locally. Unfortunately I have not been able to find them in any stores near me so I ordered them. I wear them all but they are all loose, some very loose. Annoying but they are serving their purpose so I‚Äôll probably buy them again when I need new ones."
4.0,Comfortable and look good with t shirts or causal blouse. The pants are a little long but I can fix that no problem.
4.0,Lovely but run very large This pants looked so cozy and I wanted to love them so much but they were extremely large for me.  I even double checked to inside tags.  I ended up giving them away.
4.0,Order Regular Size I like these pants but I wish I had ordered my usual size instead of sizing down as others had recommended.  I prefer a looser fit in my pants - especially if I'm just lounging around the house in them.
4.0,"Wonderful but way too big These sweat pants are soft, warm and very comfortable. My size fell between large and xl, on the size chart, so I ordered the xl. The pants are way bigger than xl, more like xxl. I would order a size down, regardless of the chart."
4.0,Great sweat pants Loose-comfy fit! Does pill in the inner leg after a few wears.
4.0,Great price The problem that I found with these pants are the waist is huge‚Ä¶I ordered PS and the waist is so out of proportion. That‚Äôs with my havingA grandma no waist anymore body and they were still huge..
4.0,Good fit These sweatpants fit well and are comfortable. They pill a bit on the inside when washed.
4.0,"Nice pants but poor fit I really wanted to like these pants. The color is as advertised, and they're well made. They just seem to run a bit large - at least on me. Returning."
4.0,Schlepping pants I usually wear a size M. I read the reviews and bought a size S. These are still quite large on me. I bought them for schlepping around the house on a snowy day so that isn‚Äôt really too big a deal.Definitely an XS would have fit better.
4.0,Size down The sweat pants are soft and nice color; however they are huge. I bought these as a Christmas present in a 2x and they had to be returned. The legs are really wide and long. Seems they would fit more like a 3 or 4x.
4.0,"Runs large Nice, but size small is way too big.  Unfortunately I have to return."
4.0,"Length is for average/tall size. The length is for average/tall, but they are very comfortable. I'm going to keep them and hem them 6 inches."
4.0,"too big really comfortable and makes you look really good too so thats why i wont be returning it but i ordered a small and it was too big on the waist, seemed like a L.  I usually wear medium but got a small because of the reviews. still love it tho, i ll sew it up to make the waist smaller"
4.0,"Run big I normally wear an xs, I have these exact sweatpants in the same size (a small) in other colors and they fit fine but the black ones run big"
4.0,Size down These run very large.
4.0,Way to big Too big went to floor when she put them on
4.0,"Soft & Comfortable I ordered these sweatpants for my mother. She was happy with the fit except for the length. They were way too long for her so we will need to take them up 2-3 inches.  Other than that, they were very soft and comfortable."
4.0,They running big for size  no elastic around Fabric is good they are not countable
4.0,Adequate pants for hanging out around the house These pants fit fine.  They are not a fuzzy as I had hoped but adequate for just hanging out around the house.  No side pockets make for a slimmer look but a back pocket would be nice.
4.0,Soft material For the price they fit nice . I just wish they came in other colors and the legs were a bit more narrow as I am only 5‚Äô4‚Äù and they are really wide on the bottom.
4.0,"Perfect for fitting over cast or walking boot! These do run a little large and I ordered with that in mind. I needed some more clothing that would fit over a cast and later a walking boot, and these more than fit that criteria. The flare at the foot end is too large for my fashion taste, but they‚Äôll be a breeze to get on. Edited: These remain a valuable addition to my clothing options while in a walking boot. Indeed, in spite of the foot of the boot extending past my toes (so quite a large 'foot,') I can still dress and undress without taking the boot off."
4.0,"Runs Big I really like the fabric, color, and softness of the fabric; however, the pants are way too big. I could easily sized down one maybe two sizes. They‚Äôre also quite long which I normally don‚Äôt have an issue with since I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6‚Äù. I would have sent them back, but it‚Äôs not worth the trouble."
4.0,Comfort The pants were purchased for comfort and that‚Äôs what I received.
4.0,Warm and soft I bought the large size so the elastic wouldn‚Äôt be too tight. Big mistake. I‚Äôll have to sew it to fit me. Because it looks like it was made for a two legged elephant.
4.0,"Size: runs HUGE. The pants are great material. soft and I would have loved them, but they are HUGE. If you normally take a medium, maybe the small will fit. I usually take a medium/large and the medium were humongous. Otherwise I would rate them with 5 stars"
4.0,"Large and long The recommended size,XL is too large for my waist and I had to insert elastic in the waistband to keep the pants from falling down.  The pant leg is too long also. I step on the hem."
4.0,A little long for my mother‚Ä¶ She was happy and sent them to be hemmed.
4.0,"Not heavyweight and no pockets These were well made and looked nice.  They run large but not enough to go down a size.  I had to return and reorder.  There were no pockets,  and are thinner than ‚Äúsweatpants‚Äù, but look nice enough to pass as knit slacks beneath a sweater.  Definitely a good value."
4.0,entirely to large I bought a large but they must run large because they are just to large.
4.0,Quality Was a gift well liked
4.0,"Runs large. I wish I could give this product 5 stars.  However, it runs about half a size too wide in the waist and the same in length.  Other than that I'm enjoying them."
4.0,Size down These definitely run big in the waist! I kinda wish they had a tie on them. Other than that they're soft and comfortable.
4.0,"Washed well Liked the fit , color and wash ability"
4.0,"Almost perfect, no pockets These are super comfortable, well made, well sewn.  I love them.  They just don‚Äôt have pockets.  Otherwise they are perfect."
4.0,"No drawstring closure No drawstring closure.  I normally wear large but ordered medium because of the reviews.  The medium fits great in the waist but is short in the crotch.  Have not washed them yet.  If the waist stretches out, there is no drawstring closure."
4.0,Good for the price It was a gift good
4.0,Comfortable Warm Pants These pants are comfortable but pockets would really be helpful.
4.0,"Nice, casual,  athletic pants. I like the colors, the material & the fit. The pants are short. So in old school terms, they ""flood."" I bought a 2XL"
4.0,How to return without the orginal wraping I liked the item it is to large. would like to exchange for a size large.
4.0,"oversized for comfort? legs are very boxy. I'm currently 20lbs overweight so I purchased a L. Could have gone for M. However, love the weight for the cold mornings and since I didn't purchase for fashion, will keep to slop around the house."
4.0,"Runs large. And description says ‚Äú draw string closure‚Äù‚Ä¶There is none‚Ä¶ just elastic. Good price for sweatpants‚Ä¶ but I wear 12/14 in most slacks. Ordered a Large‚Ä¶ too big. And no drawstring closure, (as indicated) just an elastic waist."
4.0,"Quality Control Lacking I ordered 2 pair of these in 2 different colors, same size. When I tried them on, they each fit differently. The left and right kegs were even different lengths! They are comfortable, though. I have to hem them anyway, so I didn't send them back. Just beware."
4.0,"Runs large, fabric is thin It's very lightweight. It's ok for around the house but wouldn't keep me warm enough outside in winter.Also, it runs large."
4.0,"Not bulky Light weight, fits loose. Happy with quality"
4.0,Too loose on the waist Sweat pants are nice but waist is too loose. Should have come with a drawstring.
4.0,Not the greatest color but comfy. It's stretchy and comfy.
4.0,Item runs much larger than I thought I took large and it is much too big. A small might even be my size
4.0,"Def Order a Size Down! I'm 5'9"" and 180 lbs and usually a size lrg or x-lrg. So I ordered a lrg. Well, it was too big, so if I order another pair it will be a med. The length was also not very long for my liking (ankle length), so I don't know how much shorter the medium's would be. So if you're tall, and like a long pant, these might not be for you."
4.0,"NO POCKETS! Soft fabric, washes well in cold water and low setting in dryer. Run big for me. My only complaint is no POCKETS! They are comfortable! NO, I won't be buying more."
4.0,I can usually find what I need by shopping on Amazon They are comfortable.
4.0,Comfortable sweats The color is very nice. They are comfortable. It would be nice if they had a pocket.
4.0,sweat pants I like them . they are comfortable and soft but run big . i would order a size smaller than what you normally buy.
4.0,"Medium way too large Great set of pants! Soft material and warm.  I returned the medium and placed a new order in a small size.If you are around 130lb, 5ft and 6 inches, you'll be okay with a small.Cute and comfortable."
4.0,"Great pants but run large Love these pants. They are so comfortable and soft, however, they do run large.  Normally take a small, but could have worn an XS, which was not available. They do fit, but somewhat loose. The material is great and definitely will keeep them ."
4.0,Order smaller Fit was too large at the waist
4.0,I like these I gave these a 4 star because I like them and I have reordered them multiple times. They are just a good pair of sweatpants and nothing over the top.
4.0,"RECOMMEND. Decent quality and fit. UPDATE:  Still loving these pants. I‚Äôd recommend for cool weather tho as they are sweatpants but not super heavy. Washed them in cold water and didn‚Äôt notice any shrinkage. As far as attracting lint the black pair did attract some but not enough to be problematic. So in my opinion these pants are a bargain buy. If they last only one season I‚Äôll still be a happy camper!I am 5‚Äô5‚Äù 185#.  Purchased Size Large - I was worried buying clothes online but needed casual warm lounge pants and the sale price was great. Plus it‚Äôs Amazon with no hassle returns. I wear a size 16 average and got the large (12/14) as recommended even tho the size chart indicated XL. The pants are medium weight (great for cool weather) and the large fits perfectly. Inseam hangs maybe 2 inches below ankle but doesn‚Äôt drag on floor.  I didn‚Äôt measure but I‚Äôd guess inseam at 29/30 in. I carry most of my weight in hips and legs and often have problems with the legs fitting too tight. These fit good, not tight and not baggy. Waist is a little low for my liking as I prefer high rise and these fit more at mid rise range. I love the wide waistband too. Makes for a smoother fit. Haven‚Äôt washed them yet so may shrink but I‚Äôm thinking if they do they will stretch back out. Have no idea how they will hold up over time thus 4 stars instead of 5, but for the price you really can‚Äôt go wrong. I recommend.  I will update this review in a few weeks to let you know how well they hold up after a wash."
4.0,"Sizes, sizes, sizes...??? I'm short 5'2"" and 116lbs. But my legs are thin and my butt & waist are thick.  I was waffling about getting either the medium or the small, and it's a good thing I chose Small because these pants run BIG!!!  So, if you're short and thin, expect to be doing some alterations on these pants.  The overall quality is good, and they'll come in super handy in the winter.  I wish the drop-down window would actually tell you what the sizes are comparable to in real terms!"
4.0,A reliable pair of sweatpants The Hanes sweatpants are comfortable and fit true to size. I am not seeing any balls of lint accumulating on the pants yet which is a great sign for how they will wear with washing. The pants are soft and the waistband is not scratchy. I do find that pretty much everything sticks to the pants but lint roller does work easily to fix that. The colors are true to shade. I would recommend getting the Hanes sweatpants.
4.0,"Too Long But Otherwise Fits Well, Nice and Soft I read a lot of reviews before buying these. Most said the pants were larger than normal so order down a size. Others said they fit just right. Most said they were too long. So I ended up ordering one pair of the L size and one pair of XL. I figured my husband could have the XL depending on how they turned out. I tried on the L pair, haven't washed them yet, and they fit perfectly except for the length. I did end up with a regular fit as petite sizes never showed up for me when ordering, so I expected them to be long, but not as long as they are. I'm 5'4"" and they go down about six inches past my ankles, so I have a feeling petite would have been too long also. Otherwise, the waist is perfect and the fit is fine. They're nice and soft and very warm-feeling. Since they're just to wear around the house I'll roll up the legs and they'll be okay. My husband can have the extra-large, they should fit him just about right. I've worn his 'hand-me-down' sweats over the years, normally size XL, and they've been fine on me if a little baggy. These Hanes pants seem to be men's sizes rather than women's, but with a stretch waist instead of a draw string. Maybe the manufacturer made a mistake somewhere along the line. It's interesting that the L was made in Jordan and is 60/40 cotton/polyester, while the XL was made in El Salvador and is 50/50 cotton/polyester. It will be interesting to see if/how much they shrink."
4.0,I wear size 14 pants and these are very loose Especially the waist.  However I am going to keep them as they are comfortable
4.0,I am tall - too short Too short for 5‚Äô8‚Äù
4.0,"My 2 cents worth I'm  a 5'3"" 145 lb senior. I have a thick waist and thunder thighs. I wanted something comfortable to wear around the house but still be able to run to the store because my days of wearing jeans are long gone. I ordered these in a size medium because I had read the reviews. In the past I always got a woman's large in sweatpants. For the money they are good quality warmups that have just the right weight to them, not too heavy as to be over warm but thick enough to ward off the chill and they are super soft and cuddly. Even for me the length is ok, longer than normal but will be fine with shoes. As far as size, they are a little large but won't be if they shrink any at all. I ordered 2 pair and one fits a lot better than the other. The second pair is a little big in the waist so if they are still too loose after I lander them I'll put a dart at the back seam.  My t-shirts are long enough to cover that up. The maker could solve most of the problems people are having if they would just put a drawstring in them. For the comfort alone I will be ordering more.  I really like that they are open at the bottom rather than having a cuff. For the price I am very satisfied."
4.0,"Runs big I usually wear a medium in just about every pant. These run a little big.Comfortable,  not real heavy weight"
4.0,"Comfy, but watch your size I bought the matching sweatshirt a few weeks ago and then thought I'd get the pant to go with it when the color became available.  It's comfy, no problem there.  However, I had seen comments saying they run large and was cautious.  I bought both a medium and large to try both sizes out as the size chart said I should be a large.  When they came, I tried both sizes and did indeed find they run big and the medium fit me just fine.  One other issue is the legs are way baggy down towards the ankle, they don't taper as they go down, so the ankle area is just as wide as the thigh.  Because of this, they're perfectly suited for lounge wear, but they're not for turning heads at all.  And remember to buy a size down from what you normally would."
4.0,Really soft Starts pilling after 1st wash.
4.0,Runs large and baggy leg I'm glad I read reviews and bought size small. I probably could've done XS and I'm normally a Medium.
4.0,Comfortable pant I really like that the legs are the same length and the seams don‚Äôt twist over my knee like the ones I buy from Walmart. I really like the denim blue color. The only thing I don‚Äôt like is that they are made from a much thinner fleece than the Hanes sweat pants I have purchased in the past so they probably won‚Äôt hold up as long because they do pill which makes them even thinner.
4.0,varies a bit in fit from color to color very soft and comfortable
4.0,"these are cut low? These pants are a great buy for the price. Easy washing/wear.  I bought the XX larges and they were huge! I figured maybe they might shrink, and they do but just a bit. the XXL appeared to be the equivalent of a size 42!  I returned those and got xl, and those were significantly smaller, more like an 16/18,  I have no tummy so these slip slightly off my fanny! They show just the top of a high cut thong or HANES hi cut regular underwear,  hence the 4 stars. BUT REALLY I have some pants I got from the BEAN folks and they were $40. and because they didn't taper them at all  they always feel like they are on backwards! They are made kinda boxy i like a lose leg>  They they say they are 50 /50 and that feels true to me.  I'm really obsessive about wanting as much cotton as I can get. However, Iike said, for the price you can't beat them,.....thank you HANES for an easy care, affordable, comfy pair of pants the still looks good, and that if you forget you have them on and wear them doing yard work you won't feel badly. i bought 6 pair>"
4.0,Comfortable fit Nice dark grey color. The fabric feels safer than a light steel pair I previously bought. Could benefit from having a draw string. Flattering fit for for  lounge pants.
4.0,"Very comfy! I took a chance on these pants. I was a bit hesitant because I was afraid they'd shrink and possibly be too warm. But I was pleasantly surprised! These pants are very comfortable and they don't get too warm. After I washed them, they did not shrink too much either. I'll definitely be ordering another pair. :)"
4.0,"Great! But pay attention to sizing recommendations. The most important thing you need to know before ordering these is that when they say it tends to run large, LISTEN. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6, 132 pounds and on day 2, I‚Äôm regretting not buying a small. The waist is already too loose and I wouldn‚Äôt feel too comfortable hiking or doing anything in public too...active. BUT that‚Äôs on me because I already had some doubts when I tried them on, but jeez, dude‚Äî$7.50? If nothing else, I have a reliable pair of fat pants lol. And omg they are so comfortable. If nothing else, they will make great pajama bottoms this winter (they‚Äôre nice and warm...not sure I‚Äôd wear these in the summer).Let‚Äôs put it this way: I‚Äôm about to order another pair in a small, because, again‚Äîdude, it‚Äôs $7.50‚Äìand I feel pretty confident these are gonna work. Not sure if truly petite ladies ought to buy these though. If 5‚Äô6 132 lbs is a small, I know it wouldn‚Äôt have fit back in olden days when I was a size 2-4. One last thing, sizing-wise: I‚Äôm completely pear-shaped; if you‚Äôre more apple-shaped, then your normal size might be fine. And it‚Äôs no big deal returning things on Amazon (and, dude...you know...$7.50).If the second pair doesn‚Äôt work out, I‚Äôll amend my review, but as long as you get the sizing right, hell yeah, I‚Äôd recommend these."
4.0,"These pants are all waist. Sew in a strip of elastic in the back. Otherwise, good price and product ok."
4.0,"Plain basic sweat pants They fit as expected, but are not very cozy. I just ended up not liking the way they look or feel on me."
4.0,"Larger than expected These run larger than I expected for XL. It's just one of those things, you need to try on to be sure."
4.0,Nice sweatpants for casual days. I like the way these pants fit and feel.  I do wish they were a slightly heavier material.
4.0,"Needs pockets I ordered the navy blue and the gray pants. The navy blue pants were a little tighter in the leg than the gray pants were but not uncomfortable. Both pairs are very comfortable to work out in, which is why I bought them. I do not dry them in the dryer so they won't shrink. The reason I gave them a 4 star instead of 5 stars is because they do not have pockets. A pocket down on the leg for a phone and a pocket for keys would be nice. As far as the pants, they are 5 stars, they just need pockets."
4.0,"Seems to run large Generally an XXL fits me well but these appear to run very large, especially in the waist. They are also too long for my short self!  Since they were inexpensive, I'll hem and hang on to them for days I'm working around the house and in the yard.  They are a little too slouchy for public appearances."
4.0,Big Leg Openings Just put them on and they fit great. Can't speak to longevity as I just bought them. Would be 5 stars but the leg openings are enormous. I feel like I'm wearing bell bottoms. So the air shoots up the legs to my knee.
4.0,"I stupidly bought this size because Amazon suggested it These pants would have been great if Amazons suggestion of a 2 X would not have influenced me!  I thought I was a lot Heavier than I am!  And I thought they‚Äôd shrink! They did but just a bit! So I have pants that fall down when I pull them up!  Please do not listen to Amazons suggestion about your size!  Go with what you know to be true about you!  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äù and weigh under 160, that does it qualify me for a 2X"
4.0,"Comfy Soft and comfy,  perfect for pre-surgerical clothing."
4.0,"How it fits, and how its doesn't. Maybe it's just me, but it feels like sweats are getting thinner and thinner as the years progress, and this is a good example of ""thinner sweats,"" I remember when the bulk factor for sweats was significant enough to consider what coats and other outerwear you could and couldn't wear with it.  With that caveat, not bad. They are thinner than expected, but still can be used in 45 degree morning walks without another layer, as long as you keep moving.  The legs were long enough, and the very large was just about the right size for larger hips.  But this purchase made me realize WHY some many sweatpants include drawstrings:  a good fit at the hips may or may not insure a good fit at the waist.  Also, this is another example of what extra large doesn't mean:  the length between the crotch and the top of the waist needs to be longer than it is currently.  If I wanted that much definition of my groin area, I'd wear skinny jeans, not sweats.  They are not as bad as some I've seen, but still, sweats are designed to be loose, not fitted.  While I realize that is function of those hips again, still EXTRA LARGE should include extra larger for that area too.  4 stars though because even with those complaints, still wearable, functionable, and useable."
4.0,Comfortable but too large The quality of the sweat pants material was good and soft.  I would order a size smaller than my regular size in the future.
4.0,"Should have followed the suggestions of other users - good quality material I should have followed the suggestions of other users to order one size smaller than I normally wear. Unfortunately, I didn't have time to return it and get the right size (ordered L and should have gone with the M) before I needed to use them. I was getting an MRI and needed something to wear that did not have any metal (all my other sweat pants have metal grommets). Good quality material."
4.0,"Good Pants but... I really liked these as daily wearers as I work from home, and wanted to establish a uniform. But beware ladies with sizeable hips/thighs. These pants fit me a bit loosely, which I prefer and ordered a medium, but even so I noticed friction pilling at the crotch along the thighs within HOURS of wearing them around the house. It seems to get worse with each wash unless I go in and shave them off a bit with my set of fur clippers I use for work. I don't think I should have to do that...Otherwise I'm happy for the quality for the price."
4.0,True to size and color They are a little lighter in weight than my others but works out fine for the current weather. 5
4.0,"Fit perfect, very comfortable Love these! I read all the reviews before buying, most said the pants are too big, but I wanted the general consensus. For me they fit perfectly I ordered the 2X which is my normal size. They looked too big when I first opened them but after trying on they are awesome, so soft and comfortable. I am 5‚Äô8 and they are a bit long on me- not too long where I am stepping on the hems but long enough to go an inch or 2 under my ankles. The legs are roomy, they are not tapered but straight leg. They sit an inch and a half under my belly button and are not tight (I am 48 inches around), but snug enough that they do not fall down. They are a bit thicker that normal cotton pajama pants and thinner than normal sweat pants but are fleece lined inside. Great investment for the price, bought for lounging around the house. If you are bigger in the belly like me I would recommend ordering your true size."
4.0,"Good quality but too large It‚Äôs standard Hanes quality sweat pants so it‚Äôs a good thickness and color. It was recommended for me to order true to size. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4 158 lbs and between a size 10-12 so I ordered a size large. The legs are fine- not too short or long. However, the waist is more like 2 sizes too large. When I opened the pants out of the package they looked too large. I tried them on to double check and it‚Äôs too large. I need to take them up about 2‚Äù in the waist and then run a line down the seam of the butt. If I were more curvy then it may work but I don‚Äôt have a thick butt or thighs.  I‚Äôm just wearing them around the house anyway so I don‚Äôt really care. It sits right at my bellybutton and that‚Äôs where I normally wear my pants so it‚Äôs comfortable. If I were to order again I‚Äôd get a size smaller."
4.0,"Buy a size smaller - or don't buy at all The other reviewers are right - there is something wrong with these sweatpants. The waistbands are too large for not having a string to hold them tight. I bought this in my normal size (XL) and wow it's more like a 3XL in the waist. Seriously anyone who wanted to de-pants me would have no problem with these. Definitely recommend buy one size down.However, I am keeping the pants despite the size issue because they are quite comfy and warm but not too warm. The large waistband stays up because my hips hold it in place. If I lose weight they would probably just fall off. The fabric is a soft cotton. Only time will tell if the fabric, shape, and size will hold up. These are pretty much a gamble - I probably wouldn't recommend them to anyone but I am not very picky and will keep for myself."
4.0,Warm pants These are plain and simple sweat pants. But they don't bag at the knees.
4.0,"these were well made and comfortable but run a size large I bought three pairs of these (hot pink, teal, and purple, because I was looking for the most garish colors possible, since that's just what I like to do).  The colors were exactly as pictured.Among my three pairs, the manufacture is consistent.  All the legs are the same length, there are no holes or loose seams, etc.  They are quite comfortable.  For what it's worth, the waistband is wider than an inch, but not super wide like some yoga pants.  There are no pockets and no drawstring.Regarding sizing, I'm 5'5"" and about 124 pounds; I typically wear a size 4 pant.  So I ordered the small here.  And they are just a touch too long for me as well as being somewhat loose.  If an extra small had been available, I probably would've gone with that.  However, compared to the sweatpants I am replacing (have lost almost 40 pounds this year), they do stay up, so they are an improvement in that regard.  They are also very comfortable.I do not wear these outside the house (maybe for a minute to take the dog out).  I bought them for lounging around the house in cold weather, for sleeping, and I do sometimes wear them during my morning yoga sessions as well.  They are suitable for all of these uses."
4.0,"A little large Was a little too big on me but I'm using the pants for tai chi class so it hasn't been a problem and I can move in them just fine, not entirely sure I would want to do anything more strenuous without taking in the elastic a little bit"
4.0,"Fit varies by color I first bought these pants in a Large, Grey. They were *huge* on me so I exchanged them for a Medium, Grey. They're still a little loose but much better. I love the way the pants feel so I decided to also buy them in purple. This time when I bought the Medium, they're a little on the snug side. So much that I likely will only wear them inside the house. Not sure why the grey in these pants runs so much larger than the purple. Just a heads-up if you're looking to buy either of these colors. The pants are super comfy though! I almost always put them on as soon as I'm home from work. But keep in mind that they're a winter-weight sweatpant. Anything above 50 degrees outside & you'll likely roast in them. Price is great too!"
4.0,"‚ÄúAn Acquired Taste‚Äù I ordered a small which is what I usually wear.  The sweats don‚Äôt fit or feel quite how I‚Äôd like. They‚Äôre very loose fitted. I expected them to be a little bit more snug around the hips seeing as how there is no adjustable string. They‚Äôre very long and thin so you would want to layer up if you plan on being outside in the cold. Overall, they aren‚Äôt terrible. I‚Äôll most likely only wear these around the house."
4.0,"Ya need long legs These are great. Fortunately my sister sews, so shortening them 3 inches was not a problem.  I wish the inseam length was stated clearly. I would have still purchased but not everyone has a handy sister."
4.0,These are soft and wash great! I bought because it was cold weather and I wanted these to stay warm during the day! They're a bit large but are soft and wash up nicely! They didn't shrink any!
4.0,"Size large is much smaller than size extra large I ordered these sweatpants because they do not have elastic around the ankle. The first size I ordered was XL; I could have fit another person in them with me! I returned them and got size L instead. They are much smaller than the XL, a little snug, but okay. The only improvement I would add would be pockets."
4.0,Nice fit! When I first received these and opened them they looked very large but to my surprise when I put them on they fit perfectly. I am 58 and 185 pounds and I ordered a large. I did not care for the fabric. But overall just to lounge around in they were perfect. I would purchase again.
4.0,Ran on large side I like sweat pants. These are soft. I got a small but usually I am a medium to a large. Even the small is on the big side. Good for lounging.
4.0,"Love the quality, but the waistband is a little loose There are a lot of products that look like warm fuzzy sweatpants but turn out to be too thin and not warm enough. These are made from a nice soft warm fabric, very soft on the inside. The waistband was a little looser than I expected."
4.0,its cute. but they fit large they‚Äôre just toooooo wide in the waisy
4.0,"they are ok. I just wanted some sweat pants to wear around the house. These will work. Not great, I'm not going to wear them out anywhere. Top of the let is a little tight and they could almost be considered bell bottoms. Fabric is fine for 11.00."
4.0,"good pants...to hang out in house. Ordered pants..did not realize they are petites!  Ends up right around ankle length...I prefer little longer. SO that is my fault!  Definitely order size below than you normal wear--they run larger than normal size.  They are really good to hang out in house, yard. VERY COMFORTABLE!!  I wear them a lot."
4.0,"Comfy Leisure Pant Runs Large I purchased two pair to wear at home while recovering from surgery. I tried them on and unfortunately, as stated in another review, the sweatpants ran large and had to be returned once I was mobile again. At 5‚Äô 3‚Äù the sweat pants were also too long. The pants are comfortable, have a good color, and are light to medium fabric. There is no elastic at the bottom of the leg, it is open, which is exactly what I was looking for. If you are taller than 5‚Äô 4‚Äù or so and looking for this type of leisurewear, even if you like your clothing loose -please order one size down."
4.0,"Size Runs large, synthetic material does not shrink in dryer I bought two pairs of these pants, light grey and dark grey. These run large. I knew that from other reviewers comments and so I ordered size Small, which is one size down from my normal size, Medium. For comparison my waistline is 35‚Äù, hips 41‚Äù. The inseam measurement on the pants I received is 29‚Äù. I usually wear a 30‚Äù to 31‚Äù Inseam for jeans and dress pants, but these lounge pants are synthetic material and do not shrink In the dryer. These pants actually fall below my ankle because these are more of a relaxed fit in the crotch, rather than a tailored fit. One last note, there is no drawstring at the waistline, as found in the Hanes cotton blend sweat pants, so ordering the correct size for a comfortable fit will definitely matter with these."
4.0,"Runs a size larger, and loose-ish at waist. First of all, Love these pants!So nice and comfy!I bought the ""Violet Splendor Heather"" - Purple.They run large.  I've had a (hopefully temporary) gain in weight and size and needed some comfy clothes while recovering  from a bad turn in my health.Bought a large, as I've been fitting larges recently, and realized it was just way too big for me.Not returning it.  I have big people in my family that might like this.Ordered a medium and it is GREAT!!I'm 5'10"" and these are very long!  What a relief!  Do you know how hard it is to find pants to fit a long legged woman???I'm naturally curvy, as well.The waist-band is not form-fitting.This is perfect for couch-surfing and yoga, though.The ONLY complaint I have is that there is some pilling issues.  That's it!This is a really nice pair of sweats that are warm, stretchy and long.  Oh, and great price!"
4.0,Comfortable Comfort is very important. Long enough. Washes well with no pilling.
4.0,"pants seem to have a common error - seams keep coming open in non-stressed places Pants fit just fine - loose and comfortable - however, seams keep needed to be shown for no apparent reason - not stretched or anything, just unravel in washing machine."
4.0,"These pants run larger than normal. These pants are very comfortable, however you will need to buy a size smaller than normal.  I wear a medium but should have ordered a small.  They were very large on me.  I ordered another pair in small and they fit fine."
4.0,"Soft, but too loose You definitely get what you pay for. They feel very soft and nice, but are very loose in the waist, despite being the right length. They are comfy, but do not fit near as well as they might."
4.0,Comfortable Hold up to washing and are very comfortable
4.0,"not what i expected /= for pants, i‚Äôm typically a size medium. so, i ordered a medium and it fit like a large! that + the fact that it had no pockets is what really got me. other than that, the fabric is really soft and it‚Äôs very comfy. i‚Äôm not complaining too much bc i could‚Äôve been a bit more detail-oriented and took notice that it had no pockets, but also for the fact that it‚Äôs mid november and it‚Äôll make a great (lazy) layering piece!"
4.0,"True to size So, they are very comfortable, everything about them is great! But the size is to big, I got a large (usually I get medium) but they didn‚Äôt look big enough so large was it! I‚Äôm hoping I can shrink them."
4.0,Heather Gray sizing is different. I have the same pants in black in size small. The black smalls fit perfectly. I also have heather grey size small. They are huge. The sizing for black smalls and heather gray smalls are not the same. Same for size medium. The small grays are much larger than the black mediums. I still love the pants but the weird sizing sucks.
4.0,"Work At Home I purchased these to wear at home during the pandemic while working during the winter months.  My house is older and little on the cold side, so I wanted something comfortable and inexpensive to wear during my work day.  I had no intentions of wearing them outside of the house.  I order a size down as recommended by other reviewers.  While a little on the loose side they are comfortable.  I normally buy 2x but purchased the XL.  The fabric is the right thickness for my intended purpose.  I'm 5'4 so if you are taller they maybe a little short for you, I'm ok with the length.  For the price paid no complaints."
4.0,"Reasonably priced mid weight lounge sweats I like my lounge clothing loose so I tend to size up.  I ordered a large and extra large in the event the sweats ran small.  I wear a 10-12. The extra large is HUGE and the large big, I kept the large but I haven't washed them and they will most likely shrink a bit.  I wish they were tapered a bit, they are very boxy and wide legged. So, ladies if you are looking for something that looks fashionable, take a pass on these.  They really are quite unappealing, but comfortable and do the job for chilly nights.  I would NEVER wear them outside but inside where no one sees, they are ok.  Great price too."
4.0,"Extremely large, but nice to wear around the house The overall quality is good and I'm keeping the pants to wear around the house. But they are made extremely large. I ordered the small based on other customer reviews that state the pants are made larger. I'm glad I ordered the small instead of the medium (which is what I would normally wear) because they are more like a large. I have to roll the waist band to make them fit, but the length is nice because I'm 5'8"" and typically the size small in jogger type pants would be too short, and these are actually a lot longer.For the price, you can't beat it. But definitely keep on mind that they are made extremely large."
4.0,"Order a size smaller!  My review on the way they fit is based on the smaller size. I ordered a size smaller like another reviewer had suggested and was glad I did.  My regular size would have been way too big.  The ad read ""regular/petit"" but the size chart didn't give me a choice as to which one I wanted.  I'm needing to hem them up three inches, so I'm not sure which one I got.  I ordered pants from another company that needed hemming over five inches.  I'm 5' 2"" and used to be considered of average height 50 years ago.  Guess the new generations are getting taller.  These are very nice pants; other than the length problems, the only thing I really miss is pockets!"
4.0,"They are oversized, but are great otherwise I am 5‚Äô5 and weigh about 130lbs. I ordered a Medium and it was quite big. The waist was to big for me and the legs are long. I think a small would have fit just right. I am usually a medium for any kind of bottoms so I thought a M would be right but I will be getting S next time. I would size down unless you want them to be oversized. The sweats are great material. The material is just like the brand ‚ÄúChampions‚Äù. The only thing is after 1 wear (a day long), the part where your legs rub became fussy/with lint, but you can just use a old razor to remove it. Other than that they are great, super comfy, and soft."
4.0,"Big in the waist These are soft and comfortable, a good length (I have long legs, and they are perfect), and not droopy or weirdly shaped. The one issue I have is that they have a REALLY big waist. If things are typically too tight in the waist for you, these may be perfect. I rolled them down one turn and they are fine; I'm just going to wear them this way. I'm also going to try a size down and see if that takes care of that issue. I don't care for leggings, and am looking forward to a lot of comfy evenings in non-ratty/clingy stretchy pants!"
4.0,"SIZE DOWN I bought these sweatpants to replace an oooool (10+yr) pair that I had bought at target (same size as I ordered, small) I was skeptical because surely my old pair had stretched out, but the overall style matched so I ordered the small. I'm a good 15lb heavier than I was when I got the old pair, and this size small is barely hanging onto my hips. I'm not totally complaining, but I hope a few trips thru the dryer shrink them a tad. They are also super long, but I only plan on wearing them around the house so it's not an issue for me.That being said, they are very very soft and comfy, and I paid under $6 for them so I'm keeping them."
4.0,"Beware- there are low rise sweats, and size down. I took everyone's advice and ordered a medium. I'm 5'3"" and 160#. I normally wear a 14 jeans but that's tight on the belly. I normally wear an XL in pajama pants etc. These are low rise sweats which I hate. I expected sweats to come close to my waist. I think a large wood be too big though. These are fitted in the hips but loose everywhere else. Not too loose though. I could wear them out of the house if my shirt is long enough because of how fitted they are around my hips/belly. The length was exactly 31"" which is long but I like them that way too cover my ankles when I sit."
4.0,"Runs big... I'm a med...smaller medium. My waist is 35.5 inches. And this is the largest medium possible. Thick material, good quality.No draw string, no pockets. But, very comfy and perfect lounging gear."
4.0,"Sweatpants I liked this product.  As summer is approaching, I probably won't be wearing them too much until the cooler months."
4.0,Comfortable but too big in waist I thought the medium gray pants would fit like my previous pair of a different color but these were more like a large
4.0,"Nice for the price I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5‚Äù 155lbs, 30 inch waist, 42 inch hips & I ordered a medium. I purchased a black pair of pants and also charcoal gray. The black pair fit better (slightly big, but not an issue), the charcoal gray were definitely larger at the waist (there is a gap between the fabric & my natural waist) but fit nicely on my bum and thighs. I kept both because they were nice to lounge around at home & keep me warm. The fabric has a nice thickness & inside is soft. If I were to size down I‚Äôm afraid they would be too tight on my thighs (I like loose fitting sweatpants). I think overall they are with the price!"
4.0,Size down and these are great I wear size 14p jeans and bought Medium and they fit great. The best thing about these sweats is that they do not stretch out as you wear them. The knees and butt don't sag by the end of the day. They didn't shrink either. I do really wish they had pockets but I went back and bought several more.
4.0,"Not the best quality Pants too long. Size runs big, not the best quality."
4.0,Pockets please Got these for my Mom for Christmas and she likes them except they don't have pockets. I had to hem them but she would normally take a petite and I didn't see that option. May be there and I missed it. She will wear them but she said don't buy anymore without pockets.ü§∑
4.0,"Comfortable  yet can wear to office, or out on town Pant lenth, rise above belly button, all looked good, felt good, waist felt comfortable"
4.0,"It's too large as medium I like this item, it's thick and good to wear in the cold winter. The only thing I don't expect is too large for my medium size.its loose on my hips, and legs, though I manage to sew the hips and legs side portion to reduce a little bit."
4.0,Very nice but On larger side maybe go down a size bi I like them
4.0,"A bit large but good quality and comfortable product I purchased a pair of these for an upcoming travel period going from cooler climate to warm and back again.The fleece pants are soft and well made and comfortable to wear. They are larger than expected as a size small, I bought a small after reading other reviewers and am glad I did. The waist and length did shrink a bit after washing but pants still are a tad more loose than I would like but are very comfortable. All in all I am satisfied with this purchase but would encourage other potential buyer to consider the adjustment in size when ordering."
4.0,It was good It was goodI should had gotten a size smaller.
4.0,"A little old lady-ish, but so comfy, warm and cheap, I'm keeping! They are smart to sell these for so cheap. They're comfortable, thicker than most lounge pants (which is nice for winter coming), and the length is good (past my ankle, but doesn't drag the ground). I'm 5' 8"" tall, 185# with a bit of a booty and belly. The fit is the only thing that's off-putting, as they're strangely baggy in the front (waistband fits about at my belly button). But again, at this price, I will definitely keep them, even if I do look a tad like sweet ol' Auntie Edna in them.I AM a little miffed that I paid $7.50 for these and a day later they're $5.96, grr."
4.0,"Quite Large I am an average build man, and I made the unfortunate choice of buying a medium size to find out that they run ridiculously large, so keep that in mind if you're looking to buy these. Other than that, they're very comfortable and the coloration is nice, but know that they don't have any pockets."
4.0,Comfortable. Because I have thick hips and backside they didn‚Äôt come up as high in the back as I would like. Otherwise they are perfect for lounging around in.
4.0,"Perfect length I'm a petite , so usually pants end up being too long. This one was perfect. It is just a ok everyday pants. Since it doesn't have drawstring, have to see how elastic holds up after few washes"
4.0,"Didn't know they were petite. I didn't see petite in the original description. When I got the notification they were on the way, it said petite. I'm a little disappointed. They're a little short but they were purchased for wearing around the house so I'll keep them."
4.0,"Enormous... But shrinks in the wash. I'm 5‚Äô3‚Äù, 30‚Äù inseam, size 5/6. I ordered these in small and they were humongous! I washed them in hot water and dried them on high heat. They're made of cheaper fabric, so they shrank quite a bit. They're still long enough to cover the tops of my feet. The waist and thighs fit much better, although they are still rather loose."
4.0,Great for senior saints who do not want all the buttons and zippers to deal with. These pants were purchased for my mother-in-law. She likes to wear sweat pants in the winter because they keep her legs warmer. They also can be put on with little effort.
4.0,Good pants I ordered too large Pants are great.? I ordered too large.
4.0,"Very comfy, huge at first but shrink in the wash Update: These were way too big at first, but actually shrunk to a more expected size the first time I washed and dried them. Now they are a nice pair of go-to lounge pants.These pants are quite comfortable and good for lounging around the house in. However, they are enormous. I usually wear a small or size 4 pants, and the small is about 3 inches too long (though I'm relatively short, 5'4"") and very baggy in the waist. I would recommend at least a size, if not two, smaller than what you would normally order."
4.0,"Average but not great sweats I have worn this brand for years, but this time I was disappointed.  The reviews pointed out the sizes run big and they do mainly in the waist.  The  fabric is thinner than my usual purchase of this brand, but adequate.My main complaint is the awkward fit.  You almost feel as though you have the sweats on backward.  The front waistband pulls up higher than the back.  They fit as though designed for someone with a big stomach.  I would not buy again."
4.0,"Great for short girls, medium fits size 8 perfectly Cheap, solid, comfy sweatpants. Medium weight and plenty soft, these will be excellent for sleep and lounging. They are very generously cut, which is what I want in these type of pants, but if you‚Äôre looking for a snug, flattering fit you might look elsewhere. There is no drawstring. The rise is pretty high as well. I‚Äôm size 8 and bought a medium‚Äî there‚Äôs room to spare around the waist. I will say that these are probably not going to fit taller/long legged ladies at all, I‚Äôm only 5‚Äô5 with woefully short limbs for my height and they are a bit on the short side even for me."
4.0,"So comfortable! XL is the perfect size. It feels so good wearing these, I feel like I can go outside and not worry about how my clothes fit.Edit: Had these for about a month now. Downgrading to 4 stars because there‚Äôs too much slack in the elastic waist which is why it fits a little larger. It would be better to get a smaller size, which I did, but also decided to feed another shorter length of elastic in the waist to make it stay up. Sadly I couldn‚Äôt remove the existing elastic because it was sown into the fabric with a serger and was beyond my skill to fix."
4.0,"If they make a size for you, they're a great value! As everyone else has pointed out, these run huge. I often wear a medium in sweatpants (sometimes a small, but often those are too tight in the thigh), but in these a small is very loose on me. I've thought about adding my own drawstring to help keep them up - maybe a shoelace? The fabric pills a lot in the inner thigh area and looks like it might wear out fairly quick. However, they're so cheap you could just buy more."
4.0,It‚Äôs true they run big lol. Interesting.. I love Hanes for my baby so I wanted to join the club and get some Hanes attire too. Well to start off the other reviews aren‚Äôt lying when they say size down lmao. I jus wanted some comfy pants to wear in the house or even to sleep in. Im usually a medium in anything but I got a small. If they had a XS It would be PERFECT on me. But it‚Äôs not really a big deal. Just get a size smaller. I‚Äôll probably order more cus they are soooooo damn soft and comfy.
4.0,"Happy to report these are way too big! LOL This thing gets four stars because of me and only my error. But the quality of these pants is amazing, especially for the price. I will not be returning them because they're just so comfortable. But bc I really don't feel like walking out of my pants in the streets..ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I'll do myself (and the community) a favor and purchase a size or two down. I suggest that if you have the time, use the 'try before you buy option."
4.0,Wider leg than shown Fit fine. Wider leg than shown.
4.0,"Quick and comfy! I love these (I bought 2 different colors).  I didn't have high expectations.  I just opened the box.  My mom is with me and we both put a pair on.  She told me Hanes is a good brand, but at about $5, I expected them to be ""off"".  She is a couture seamstress, and examined the sewing.  They are fleece!  (There's not much real fleece available in Florida.)Just this week it has gotten down to the low 40s in the night, and  I have been freezing, so this was a quick fix for a couple days. They came 'next day' and I am so comfortable in them right now!  I'm 5'7"", medium build, large is not too loose and a great length.  To long for my envious 5'3"" mom."
4.0,"Runs large I was contemplating between medium and large and ended up going medium due to the reviews. I should‚Äôve gotten a small! Lol these run large and are very loose at the waist with no drawstrings, size down"
4.0,Comfy but lacks pockets Love it they are super comfy!!! Only real complaint is they‚Äôre loose in the waist and no pockets.
4.0,Runs WAY large! I admit it said in the description it ran large... but it's WAY large! And whether they would shrink alittle after washing I'm  not sure... But definitely will have to exchange for a smaller size.
4.0,"Size down for relaxed ‚Äî or down two for fitted. Because of the super low price I picked up two pairs of grey and two navy. Based on the reviews I picked them up in petite medium, as well as two additional navy in regular small.I am 5‚Äô2, 165lbs with a definite ‚Äúmom pooch‚Äù (partial diastasis recti). I normally purchase size large in a ‚Äòshort‚Äô length, and petite is normally a bit too short.While the size small fit, they were fitted and accentuated my mom pooch. The regular length was also too long. I purchased these for lounging around home in the Minnesota sub-zero winters, so I wanted a more relaxed fit. The medium petite fit perfectly. While I am tempted to purchase more for the price, I don‚Äôt really need any."
4.0,"Petitte is questionable I ordered 2 pair in a XL. The title in the product reads ""Petitte"". This is a gift for my daughter who is 5ft 2in. They are not Petitte in length.  I will be hemming them up.  Good material. Can't go wrong with Hanes except for the length."
4.0,"Runs large These pants are a good value.  They do run large. I wear size 14 and medium fits perfectly. I bought a couple pair sized medium for my mom who wears a size 8 And an XL for myself. Way too big for my mom, so I kept the 2 pairs of medium and gave my daughter the XL one. Turned around and ordered a couple of small sized ones and they are just right for my mom. In total I bought 5 pair. They are comfortable and we wear them all the time. I plan to order more."
4.0,Nice pants These pants are comfy and great around the house or doing quick earnings. Loving these pants they are slightly long but that‚Äôs fine for me.
4.0,Petite I ordered petites so they wouldn‚Äôt be to long. They were still to long. I measured the inseam is 31 inches long. A little on the Long side to be called petite.
4.0,"Overall good for average to athletic build. I'm 5'8"" and athletic in build. These are comfortable but I would have preferred them to be a little longer, however, given they were on sale for $7.50 a pair I'm not turning them down or complaining. The material is slightly thinner than I was hopeful for but again, can't beat the price and I'm contemplating ordering a few more. Overall, a good fit for me. If you're a little bit bigger in the butt or thighs I would probably find a different brand, I could see these being a tight fit."
4.0,Order a size down. These pants are much larger in the waist than expected. I only got one pair so I didn‚Äôt return them thinking they might shrink in the dryer. They don‚Äôt shrink.
4.0,"Comfort. Very comfortable.  Just right hang. However they do run true to size. If you normally wear a 12-14 size, which I do. Size large, best to get one size down."
4.0,"Most unsexy comfy pants ever made Great to stay home in the winter because it‚Äôs comfortable and warm. Absolutely catastrophic if you‚Äôre looking to get frisky with your significant other: it‚Äôs the most unsexy comfy sweatpants ever made! I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5‚Äù and 130lbs, straight body, flat tummy and a size S (small) sits nicely between the hips and the belly button. The length is a bit long, so it swipes the floor for an extra notch of unsexiness galore! Perfect for Zoom meetings where you never have to get out of your seat to fully display your quarantine look!"
4.0,"Practicle and Comfy I'm currently a stay at home spouse and I have a lot of chores to do around the house and my gardening. These pants are exactly what I was looking for. They are very comfortable and the price is right. I will say the sizing is a bit off. I am a size 10/12 and I would normally wear Med. to Large depending on the pants. However, listening to the previous reviews, I purchased a size S. Let me tell you, they fit perfect. I'm sure a M would have been too big. I actually order 4 pairs altogether."
4.0,"Comfortable pants at a great price An excellent price for a pair of comfortable sweat pants. The material is slightly thinner than other sweats, but still warm. They make good indoor lounge pants.  As other reviewers have stated, the pants do run a bit large. I'm 5'6"", 27"" waist, and an hourglass figure. I ordered a size small, regular length.  The pants are a bit long on me, and they sit loosely (but not too loosely) on my waist. I like that the pants are ""EcoSmart"" and I will probably order them again, especially at the price."
4.0,"Ordered a medium I'm 5'6"", 136 lb., and normally get a L, but I followed the reviews to order a size smaller.  I order the Med, the waist fits perfectly, as well as the rest of the item.  The length was good.  The fabric is not too thick or too thin.  I haven't washed it yet, so I don't know if it will shrink.  I hope it doesn't as there's not much room for shrinkage on me.  The color, a dark gray, is just as pictured.  Happy I ordered this item."
4.0,"Too big I should have returned the medium for a smaller size, but kept them to wear around the house.  I normally wear a medium to large, but these were huge around my legs and loose so around my waist and hips.  Still warm and comfy though.  I'm 5'6 and weigh around 150.  I bought another pair a few weeks later in a small and they fit perfectly."
4.0,"Great for pear shaped bodies I almost didn‚Äôt get these because so many people said the waistband was loose and kept falling down. The only thing I can think of is those women did not have a pear/triangle shape. If you have a smaller waist and wider hips, these should fit you just fine.  If you have straight hips, these will not fit your shape well.I bought 4 pairs and wore them for two weeks straight during a physical protection course, where I was physically active for roughly 5-8 hours a day.  There was no stretching, no falling down, I don‚Äôt even think I felt my crack make an unwanted appearance! LOL!!!My only reason for not giving 5 stars is due to the amount of lint that comes off on me during wear, even after prewashing and a couple of washings after, and no pockets.  These could use some pockets for sure!!!"
4.0,"Run Big in Waist These are nice plants, but they run a little bug in the waist. Everywhere else fit fine. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3‚Äù and 136 lbs. I purchased a medium and now I just purchased a small, as the medium was too loose in the waist. I tried to roll them down at the waist area which helped keep them up better, but still bigger than I need them to be. Just wish they had pockets too. Gave 4 stars, for no pockets."
4.0,"Runs big, but soft I‚Äôm usually a medium, so I bought a small, but the pants are still baggy around the waist and down the leg. I‚Äôm about 5‚Äô4‚Äù and the length is about 2 inches past my ankle.  There‚Äôs no XS left, the pants are soft, and I was going to use them as PJ‚Äôs anyway, so I am going to keep them, but they would be too big to wear in public; there‚Äôs no drawstring and I‚Äôd be worried about them falling down.  You may want to go down more than one size."
4.0,"Does run too large, lined for cooler weather Based on Amazon's recommendation and my previous purchases, I chose a medium. I agree with many of the other reviews stating that the sizing runs large. I am on the fence about returning it. It's definitely not fitted but not so loose it will fall off. It also has some type of lining that will make this good for cold weather, but it's not a lightweight material that would be good year-round."
4.0,"Soft and comfortable The pants are a little long, but I'm a little short.  Easy fix.  The are a little large, but that just makesthem more comfortable."
4.0,"They run larger than what you would normally wear I am a size 14 right now and these run big.  I purchased a XL and should have bought a L.  I have worn/washed/dried a few times hoping they would shrink, but they haven't so that's good when you by the correct size.  I believe if the size was good around the waist, the length would be perfect.  Like the bottom how they don't have the tight elastic around the ankles.  Price is worth it."
4.0,wide legs The legs are really wide and the bottoms look like bell bottoms.  Plenty of room to wear long johns under.
4.0,Idon‚Äôt like it Okay
4.0,Nice Sweat Pants A little too big and long for me. Other that nice sweatpants to hang around the house in.
4.0,"Nice Feel but too long I ordered a pair of these sweatpants. They fit at the waist and was a very nice feel, however, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô1 and they were very long. It mentions in the description petite sizes are available but I wasn‚Äôt given an option for petite sizes when ordering. I went to the Hanes  page and it did not give me an option for petite sizes there as well. I‚Äôm wanting to order a couple more pair but not at the long length."
4.0,"Heavy weight fabric? No These sweats are not as heavy as others o have. Even though they are shorts, I will need to hem them. I am 5‚Äô 4‚Äù."
4.0,"Good Buy! I have been searching for open hem sweatpants to replace my favorite pair which finally wore out.  In my quest I have purchased and returned several expensive pairs  and finally decided to give these a try.  They are perfect!  Nothing fancy, no pockets, just basic warm open hem sweatpants for a great price.  They fit loose, maybe a little big, but they're perfect for hanging around the house.  A very good buy!"
4.0,"Comfy I had to take the waistline in, but I usually do if I want to buy pants big enough for a comfortable seat. These are very comfortable! Just wished that they had pockets."
4.0,Good product Good product
4.0,"Big and comfy These are great sweatpants and I would have given them 5 stars if they had a drawstring. At the ‚Äúadd on‚Äù price it was worth exercising my sewing skills and adding a drawstring so they don‚Äôt fall off! If you are looking for a pair of nice ‚Äúsweatpants‚Äù (because these look good for leaving the house) that offer plenty of room these are it. I haven‚Äôt washed them yet and at 5‚Äô8‚Äù I m hoping the length in the XL doesn‚Äôt shrink to become waders. I bought these wanting something comfy to wear after knee surgery- these fit the bill. Not sure how they will hold up, but I‚Äôm happy because they will meet my immediate needs. They do run larger than average, and the waist is about the same size as the hips, so if you don‚Äôt know how to add a drawstring, buyer beware! If there is elastic in the waist band it has evaded me."
4.0,"Order a size down I usually wear a 12, but I saw people saying to order a size down so I ordered a medium and it fits perfectly. It's very soft, too. But, yes. Listen to the reviews that say these sweatpants are large. I'd really say these are plus sized and if you aren't plus sized no size of these sweatpants is going to fit you."
4.0,Happy w purchase but take heed... Listened to reviews and ordered a size down.  I‚Äôm normally a solid large but ordered medium .  Medium fits great.  The only ‚Äúbut‚Äù is the pants are too long for me but I‚Äôm handy w sewing machine and will hem up.  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5‚Äù  and will need to take up at least 1.5 inches- maybe 2 inches.  (4 instead of 5 stars)  Super comfortable.  Well worth the trouble hemming.  Recommend
4.0,very comfy These pants are very comfortable. They are soft and I love the style. I should have ordered a size smaller because they run very big at the waist. I was contemplating ordering a smaller size but the L was twice the cost of the xl. I wish all sizes were the same price. I probably won't wear these out for fear of them falling down. I can probably wear them over leggings to clean snow or walk in the cold.
4.0,"Super comfy but a bit large. I'm 5'3"" 150lbs...bought a medium and they are very long and fit very loose around the waist.  Super soft and comfy, just run a bit larger than expected."
4.0,"RUNS LARGE N LONG........ These HANES SWEATPANTS, SIZE MED, IN BLUE, arrived ahead of time n are very well made. HOWEVER, i would of gotten a small size had i known how long they are and the waist being way too large for a medium size. Thats why i gave only 4*s.The quality is Excellent tho and the price is great, especially these days when we have to stretch every dollar. ENJOY ALL N KEEP SAFE!!!"
4.0,"Comfy and Economical I was looking for a pair of inexpensive sweatpants for lounging. I'm having surgery that will put me in a boot, and I needed something wide enough at the bottom to fit over my boot and something I could comfortably lounge around the house in while I'm healing. I also didn't want to look like a total bum. These are comfy and decent looking...especially for the price! They're a little thinner than I'd hoped, but they're still warm and very comfortable."
4.0,"Comfy & Warm; Not for Petite Ladies I am 5'1"" and these pants go above my bellybutton at the waist and I have to cuff them twice at that bottom so that they don't drag on the floor.  However, I am sadly used to this when there is no 'petite' option to select.Aside from the (predictable) fit, these are great. They're warm, they're comfortable and they are nice to wear around the house for lounging.I wish they had pockets."
4.0,"Mixed The fabric is very light, so not quite what I expected of  ""sweat"" pants. I'm 5' tall, 118 lbs. The waist and hips, which are somewhat slim, fit fine. The legs were loose, as expected, but they were at least six inches too long for me. I suppose there must be people who are of those proportions. I cut the extra material off. Am wearing around the house anyway.  This item is very inexpensive, so can't be disappointed."
4.0,"Very comfortable, but size runs big These are very comfortable and soft sweatpants.  Nice quality, does not look or feel cheap.  I bought a small which is 4-6 and they are BIG.  I would have returned them for a smaller size, but I got them on sale for super cheap and wouldn't be eligible for the sale price.  Mind you I bought 4 pairs!  But, I wear them around the house...so they are fine.  Definitely recommend them for lounging."
4.0,"Started to pill on very first wear at home... Love sweatpants but Hanes quality seems to have declined. In the first wearing around my home it has already begun to pill in between thighs, butt and crotch. I can understand if after months and months of wear, but the very first wearing? I‚Äôm unsure if I‚Äôm going to return, the price $5.96 was great, but having to shave the pills off every time I wear I‚Äôm unsure of, also wish they had pockets."
4.0,"Wash by itself first time The pants fit perfectly. Just a warning though that when you wash them for the first time, don't put anything else in the machine with them or you will have fuzzy clothes.  I did a load, all dark clothes, along with the pants and the lint catcher was jammed with lint from the pants and the other clothes had lint all over them. I've washed the pants a second time, alone, and there's not as much lint but still a little. Other than that, very pleased with purchase."
4.0,Comfy for home The price was the determining factor for this purchase. They are warm and comfy to wear around the house. The gray is just too light for me to even make a quick store run.
4.0,"Great for lounging or yoga I wouldn't recommend vigorous workouts in these pants because they might actually fall off, but if these pants had pockets and a draw string, they'd be perfect for any activity. The pants were a little bigger than I expected. As a female who is 5'6"" pants of this style are often too long for me.. so, they are a little baggy at the waist and the legs are a bit too long but I don't mind because they are SOOOOO comfortable. The fleece inside is so soft- they are also kinda thin... these wouldn't be great for Michigan winters but are perfect for Arizona winters! And the price is basically unbeatable... I highly recommend these comfy pants!"
4.0,"these are GREAT pants in all ways but sizing. i always fit into size xl. i am 5'5"" and 180 lbs. their xl were way too big, especially in the waist and fanny, also too long.  So i returned them in their simple to return policy and got 1 size smaller. they fit, but are still a tiny bit too big.Otherwise i love them. they wash well, are warm, but do breath. are a bit stretchy, but not too stretchy. I love there is not a tie in the waist."
4.0,"Ebony Fit is Larger than the Other Colors I own several pairs of Hanes Ecosmart Sweatpants in various colors and for some reason the Ebony ones are much larger in the waist than the other colors.And for some reason, this is also true with Hanes Cinch bottom Sweatpants as well.So be aware of this if ordering Ebony.I really wish that Hanes would bring back their drawstring sweatpants."
4.0,"Haynes sweat pants. They are a little loose but it's my fault.  I already have a pair of Haynes sweatpants size small, they fit well but when I sit in my recliner they kind of cut me at the waist.  I now have pancreatic cancer & get chemotherapy and sit for long hours.  I wanted them a little bigger at the waist but there is a big difference. These are a different style, probably why."
4.0,Rinse before wearing. I like the fit except for the length. I am petite so they are really long on me. I will hem them as I usually have to do. Nice material.
4.0,"Soft and warm Too long for me, 5‚Äô1‚Äù but they are very soft and warm. Only if they came in petite"
4.0,"Too wide and too long= Not Petite! But we bought a 2nd pair! I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6‚Äù so I expected these to be short on me and originally bought them for my mom who is shorter than me. Well, these were too long in me so my mom decided to keep them because she liked the material and were about $8 so she‚Äôs going to cut a bit of the bottom. They are also wide for size ‚ÄúS‚Äù and I‚Äôm about 137 lbs. We bought her a 2nd pair since they are cheap!!!"
4.0,"Great Casual Pant I bought these to work from home comfortably during the fall and winter months. I did not find them too large at all and that they fit as expected.  However, I am short and just wished they were sold as advertised in petite lengths, but there were no petite sizes at all. Therefore I will have to hem about 2.5 inches shorter. I am 5' tall and weight 140 and the medium fit was a perfect fit for me -- just too long."
4.0,"Fit These pants are a dream.  I took the advise from others and ordered a size smaller than I would have (I had thought I wanted the large) and I'm glad I did.  The fit is a bit loose at the waist (I prefer that), but the fit in the legs was just right.  If I had ordered the next size up, they would have been way too big."
4.0,"Large leg bottoms. Good priced sweat pants. They do run a little large, especially at the bottom of the legs, but that's no big deal. The have a soft cozy fleece feel on the inside. I would buy them again and recommend them to others."
4.0,"Comfy but not adjustable waist Very comfy fabric. Not heavy as some can be. The issue is (as others have written) that there is nothing to adjust the waist. It is a tad too big in the waist but the next size smaller, was too tight for it to be comfy. I only wear them at home because they have to be pulled up a lot. They make great stay at home pants."
4.0,"Runs somewhat large. I was aware when I bought these that they're not exactly form fitting. Their purpose is comfort. I'm completely satisfied and received exactly what I expected. I was, however, disappointed to find theheather blue pair I received is a cinched leg. I ordered all 3 pair as open bottom leg."
4.0,"make sure you order a size down I read all the reviews, but didn't order a size down.  I should have.  After returning a medium (my ALWAYS size), I ordered a small (I am not a small), and found that once I laundered--both washed and dried--the item, they fit perfectly.  Still a little large in the legs before laundering, but fine after.  At the price, this is a great buy.  The pants are soft and comfy."
4.0,"Comfy ...but the sizes are off I love these sweatpants, I bought two in Large...ebony and navy heather. I received both in the correct size (according to the label). The legs on the blue is significantly longer and wider than the black (approx 2 inches). The black fits me perfectly (160lbs, 5""5""). Even though the blue runs slightly bigger, they are still very comfy. But if you want one that fits properly, I suggest going a size smaller if you are purchasing the blue."
4.0,"Super comfy These run a bit large. I ordered my usual size and I keep having to pull them up. Fortunately, these, for me, are meant to be worn around the house and for curling up on the sofa. They are very comfy, and if I could get them a half size smaller and in other colors, I would buy a bunch.You can't beat the value for the price you pay."
4.0,"Fit Larger than Expected I bought these sweatpants for wearing around the house or to the gym. Based on reviews, I purchased a size medium. I am 5'5"" tall and weigh 153lbs so I though a medium might even be a bit snug. The fit was OK around my thighs and butt but the length was too long and the waist was very loose. I've decided to keep the 2 I bought and have the waist taken in and just use them for around the house. The price was so inexpensive it is not worth the time to return. The quality of the material is good though (nice and soft) so if you find the right fit, these are a great buy!"
4.0,"Soft comfy stretchies I really like these pants. They are very comfortable and the length is perfect, just about to the floor but I‚Äôm not walking on them. I‚Äôm generally XL so ordered that size. These fit loosely and the waste, with no draw string, is a bit too loose. I feel they slide down when walking or moving. I‚Äôm keeping these for around the house but I just ordered 2 more one size down. Soft cloth, very comfortable and can be worn for exercise but also around town not looking like I‚Äôm on my way to the gym.  I recommend but size down."
4.0,like them Since the pandemic we have all gained weight. Got these in a large and they fit a little loose but comfortable. They are long but it is better than being short and I only use them around the house . For the winter around the house instead of P.J.'s they serve the purpose. I take a size 14 in jeans so the large was fine.
4.0,Bought  for my wife My wife needed some lounging pants for home.She said these are very comfortable
4.0,"Best sweat pants I am obsessed with this specific pant. I have a pair that has lasted 6 years with heavy use. They are thick and very soft inside!  My only complaint is that the black ones seems to be cut differently than the other colors. I've had multiple black ones from different stores and they always vary, so I assume that is a manufacturing issue."
4.0,"Nice but large So for the price these pants are nice and comfy. But they are LARGE! I normally would wear an Xtra large, but after reading the reviews I ordered a large. They are still almost too big. I am not a small woman and I think I could fit in a medium if I ever ordered again. As I said, they are good pants, but make sure you order a size down, maybe even 2 sizes."
4.0,"Comfy, but wish they had pockets! Comfy, but wish they had pockets!  If there were pockets, I‚Äôd give it 5 stars."
4.0,"Very comfy bur runs a bit large I'm 5ft7, 130lbs and ordered a Small size. The length is pretty good, covering my whole legs which i like, but the waist is a bit too loose. Material is comfortable but not that quality ( you get what you pay for). Wish there is X-Small size, that could work perfectly."
4.0,Great for at home So the pants are a bit long for my height no big deal since i bought them for lounging around the house for the winter. Around my waist i like it i know a few people think it's a little big and i see that but i am in between sizes so for me it's just right for lounging. I would size down if you're looking for a more fitted look
4.0,Great fit- runs just a bit big Love the feel- the fabric is super comfortable! They do run just a bit large- I am very pear shaped so I ordered a 2x (normal size) but could have fit nicely into a XLI wish it had pockets and draw strings but for the price they are nice for PJ bottoms or lounge pants!
4.0,"Great for the price! I just got these today and besides the fact that they sent me the wrong size (I ordered small, they sent small petite), these are really soft inside and cozy. That said, I am ordering more in the correct size.  These are not huge like the other reviews state. I ordered the black and they fit true to size.  For reference my measurements are 38-28-38.  I am 5 foot 9, hence the petite were too short.  Small fit perfect IN BLACK.  Perhaps the color of the material effects the sizing.  For black, you can order true to size.I took off one star cuz they sent the wrong size. GREAT PRICE!"
4.0,Great for at lounging at home Fit is as expected. Loose & comfortable. Great for those lounging days at home.
4.0,"The medium was too big The medium was more like a large, too big. I got the small and they came too little üòï"
4.0,"Complicated fit - waist gaps, hips snug These are sweatpants, so fit should not even be an issue.  But it is.  The reviews indicate the pants run large.  Well, the non-adjustable waist does run  large.  However, the rest of the cut is snug.  The pants slip to below the belly-button because of the gapping waist.  In the future, I will buy pants with an adjustable waist/drawstring."
4.0,"This item does run large This material is warm and almost indestructible. I have washed it numerous times and the material does not really shrink. These do run on the larger scale as to size, and that is the only problem. There is no drawstring at the waist and I feel like I am going to walk my pants off. I have put this through the wash a few times hoping they would get a little tighter, but no. You may want to try a size down for sports and buy your regular size for lounging. Because these run large they are great for layering if you need to bundle up in the snow."
4.0,"Too long These pants are warm,I did have to size down 1 size. My only complaint is for a petite,  they are still too long for me.."
4.0,NOT ALWAYS PETITE I order these for my mom. She‚Äôs short so we need petite. It‚Äôs hit or miss w/these. Usually not petite but sometimes they are. You can tell cause some are too long and some have a label on them that say petite. N they‚Äôre short. Beware.
4.0,large nice price too large.I ordered another pair in medium
4.0,Order a size smaller than you normally wear!! I ordered medium and they are too big...Have to go back!!
4.0,"Well-made but get a size smaller than you normally wear I bought these without first reading the reviews, so my bad that they don't fit as described. First, they are not petite at all. They are about 4 inches too long. Second, I bought the large and they really are large, but after washing them in cold water and running them through the dryer, they have shrunk a bit in the waist and bottom, which makes them fit better. It hasn't shortened them at all. I'll have to do that.But they are well made and thick. They can stand up to going through the washer/dryer and not look worn out after only a few washes, like some other brands. And I like that they feel cozy on. I'd like to get a another pair but this time, I'll get medium. If you aren't sure about which size to get, especially if you're dieting, pick the size you wear now and get a size smaller."
4.0,I would get the next size up for a good fit When my mother first tried on the pants they fit almost perfectly just a little long. I did not like the fact that after the first wash pants did shrink and now the length is a bit short and pants a bit tight. Can I return the pants and get the the next size up?
4.0,"Comfortable I ordered two pairs of these for around the house.  I could not figure out how to order the petit size so I ordered the regular length.  I had to hem them but they are a great price and very comfortable.  They wash well and look nice enough to run an errand without that ""sweat pants look""."
4.0,Odd fit. Compaired to other Haines products the wife has bought. Wife says that the waist is loose fitting and the length is really long on a 5 ft 2 inch person.But she says the quality is good and the price is cheap.So she will keep them .
4.0,"Size down These run a little big, but I'm fine with that since that means I can throw them in the dryer with no worries of them shrinking.  They are very comfortable and warm. They did get pilling in the inner thigh area where it rubs, so time will tell how long these will last, but for the price I am mostly satisfied with them."
4.0,Good but not perfect Gift for 88yo mom. She says the fit OK but a little loose in waist. Bought women's small.
4.0,"Leg width is a little wide Looks too large before washing.  After wash, fits better, just leg width is a little wider than expected."
4.0,"Sweatpants Nice, warm, and comfy. I have full hips and butt. I would have liked a little more room in the butt. It gives me NO extra room to work with in this area. Also, a drawstring would have been nice. I find that since it doesn't sit at my waist in the back, it has a tendency to slide down."
4.0,"At home comfort These pants are very comfortable, they could be a tad longer and I wish they had pockets. My biggest complaint is that they pull quite a bit. Having said that the price is great and they are very comfortable. I didn't buy them for fashion I bought them for comfort and warmth. Will see what happens after a few washings."
4.0,Size 10=Small I bought a medium but it was too long and a tad loose. They were a bit too big and so I went down to a small. And I am a size 10/12 for pants and was already ordering a size down by not getting a large. So size 10 pants (women‚Äôs adult size) is a Small for these. Otherwise super comfyüëç
4.0,The material and pants are great but they definitely did not run big. Waist is NOT tight at all. The material is very soft
4.0,Warm and a good value These are nice winter pants but could be 2 inches longer.
4.0,"Good but.... I love these pants...they are very comfortable.  I first bought petite because I am 5'3, but they were shorter than I wanted.  I really like the regular length but don't think a tall person would.  The reason I only gave 4 stars is because they pick up a LOT of dog hair.  Not a problem if you don't have a shedding dog."
4.0,be very careful and pinus when you're short person because they are very long They fit true to size they're high-rise but if you're a short person they are way too long
4.0,Love them! As advertised!
4.0,"I want pockets! Great price! They are a tiny bit long on me, but I‚Äôm short so I expected that. Otherwise the fit is great. I love the color and definitely want to get other colors. I might have to check out the men‚Äôs version though because if they have pockets I need them!"
4.0,"Comfy! I love these sweatpants so much I bought three pairs! The inseam is maybe an inch too long for my legs, but that's nothing a woman my height isn't used to. The only thing that could possibly make them better would be pockets, but other than being pocketless they're well on their way to being my favorite trousers."
4.0,Run too large I like the pants but the small is much too large in the waist. I would order extra small if it was available. Gave them to my Mother who usually wears medium size. The mediums I ordered for her (in a different style) were way too big for her also.
4.0,Warm n fuzzy I wear a 1412 depending on the brand I purchased an extra large of this sweatpants and it was huge I purchased the large and there‚Äôs a lot of extra room I purchased the lawn I appreciate the wind comes down to the bottom of my shoes where I feel pants should say keep my legs warm up I will probably order a medium because this still is true roomie but I blame that on lack of standards of sizes not the labeling in this area it was smaller than the extra-large
4.0,Waist is very loose and rise is long I like that legs were roomy. I have to roll the waist.
4.0,"Order a size down. These have about a 34"" inseam. Loved the material.  The top fit perfectly but the bottom was way too big I should have ordered 2 sizes smaller. It may not be the manufacturers fault.  I've been sick lately and I think I've lost weight.  But one thing for sure that wouldn't matter is the length.  The bottom to the set have about a 34 inch inseam."
4.0,"Overall a Good Value I have purchased several pair in size medium and large. The mediums fit perfectly until I washed them, and then they seem to have shrunk a little. The large seem loose and long, but we'll see what happens once they're washed. For around the house, and chasing after the dog outside, these are just fine."
4.0,Ordered correct size in 2nd order I took the advice from the reviews and ordered a size larger. I ordered large and they were mega too big. That‚Äôs fine because I can wear them as the outer pants here in the winter months in my cold climate. I then ordered two pair of mediums and they fit fine except for they are very long. I will have to hem them.
4.0,"Pockets would've made these a 5 star item Love everything about how these pants fit and feel. Low maintenance, perfect length. The ONLY complaint I have is what's universally crappy about women's pants - NO POCKETS. Not just these pants, for some reason every women's pants maker thinks a woman shouldn't have pockets. Why? It's a mystery to me..."
4.0,Pretty good. Good  glad I bought a size smaller the lenght a bit long.
4.0,Buena tela Excelente calidad
4.0,"Warm and Cozy Sweatpant These sweatpants are comfortable, warm and cozy and fit as expected. So far, I've washed them twice in the machine w/ warm water and tumble dried them on high, and they did not shrink. They've kept their shape and the original pant length is still fine (no ""flood-zies""!).  I'm happy with the quality and will probably purchase another pair soon. Good product for the $$"
4.0,"Too long There was no way to order them in Petite for a shorter length, so these are 1-2 inches too long.  Otherwise, they fit great."
4.0,"Order your normal size I ordered an XL based on reviews not the large I would normally order. I am 5‚Äô7‚Äù and 180lbs.  They were too big in waist.  They don‚Äôt have a drawstring so while I can wear them to bed, I wouldn‚Äôt be able to wear these in public.  Other than waist size, very comfortable and good length."
4.0,Just what I ordered Great for the price. Good buy
4.0,"Nice pants I like this pant but unfortunately they are very large, I normally wear a large however, this was extremely large, I don't think the sizing is correct seem more like XL or XXL."
4.0,"Heed size advice I'm built like a Guindon character (picture a potato on toothpicks), so I did not heed the advice of others to order a size smaller. It's actually slightly loose on my waist and really baggy on my bum, but I can wear it on days like Thanksgiving (I stay home...no need to call the fashion police). I did order a different color in medium and hope that fits a little better."
4.0,Runs large but will probably shrink Not real sweats . comfortable and fabric not too heavy for me
4.0,"Order a size down I'm 5'7"", 160 lbs.  I ordered a size M, and they're a bit loose in the waist, and a bit long.  That being said, they are amazingly comfy for both lounging and running errands.  I absolutely love wide leg sweats, leggings (jeans) and was happy to see that they are available in several colors.  I purchased the black, gray and blue.  The colors are very deep which is great for a ""no-show"" pant.  At this price and the comfort they offer I'll be re-ordering as needed and would recommend."
4.0,"Runs large The reviews are correct about sizing.  Pants run a bit large.  I am a small or medium depending, and I am glad I chose small.  Fits well (5‚Äô4‚Äù and 135 lbs) and very comfy.  But, I was a little disappointed that the pants have nothing at the ankle and do not taper.  The flow a bit wide at the bottom."
4.0,"Loose but comfy I ordered a size down due to all the reviews saying these run big. They definitely do. I don't mind the looseness though, I can easily layer a pair of leggings underneath in the winter. Will be buying more but a size smaller so I can wear them if I need to run a quick errand and don't want my pants falling down."
4.0,"Nice athletic pants with boot cut at ankle I rated based on the actual pants for and quality. I did return but because I wanted a lighter fabric and these are more of an athletic feel, not what I was looking for. They fit well. I am a size 14 and ordered an XL and they were perfect. Not form fitting. Boot cut legs."
4.0,"The Most Comfortable Lounge Pants I've Ever Owned. I love these! I use them for loungewear, and they are beyond comfortable. I would give them 5 stars, but they pill after a few washings. For me, it doesn't matter since I don't wear them out. I will be buying another pair soon because, when I wash mine, I want to have a spare."
4.0,"Comfy and classic These sweats are so comfy and well made. They're thick and warm and hold up to washing well. They do run very large: in the waist, rise, length and hips and thighs. Definitely size down a size or two, but still a great value."
4.0,I thought I ordered a large but received a small.  Gave the pants to a friend. Too small and gave the item to a friend.
4.0,Dealer The item is slightly large but I will keep it. What  disturbed  me is I got one with the Plastic package already ripped open and It have a small stain along the right leg. Maybe a return???  They were so inexpensive I will keep them because I‚Äôm just going to lounge in them but  think the dealer must‚Äôve been responsible?
4.0,"Size down Luckily, I read the reviews that they run big and sized down. I would normally order L or even XL if it seems it may run on the smaller side. I ordered M and it was perfect. Seeing as they don't have a drawstring, I would definitely recommend sizing down or they won't stay on. They are comfortable and totally worth the money."
4.0,"warm These do run a bit large.  The reviews i read said they ran large for the petite sizes, but the ladies close to my size said they were perfect.  I am 5'7"" and 165.  They fit well in the butt and thighs but but a little big in the waist.  Of course women are all built so differently it is hard to find a perfect fit.  Overall comfy sweats and i did wear them into town today to run errands.  I bought a Large and I believe a Medium might have been to tight in the butt and thigh for me.  I would suggest ordering 2 sizes and returning the size you don't like."
4.0,"Order a size smaller. I ordered a M and I wear a size 10-12, 5'2"".  They fit but ate very long.I ordered 4 colors. Got 3, 2 are the same color. The Heather blue has a slightly smaller waist than the black and light gray. I'll just be wearing them around the house so that's ok."
4.0,Worth the price would buy again. The fit was as expected.
4.0,"Runs big in the waist These pants are soft, but they do seem a bit big in the waist.  I usually wear a size large in sweatpants and this one is pretty loose so I wouldn't wear them out and about for fear they may fall when I squat.  It would really be beneficial for them to have a drawstring to alleviate this issue."
4.0,"Run VERY large! Nice thick sweatpants.  No pockets or drawstring.  RUNS VERY LARGE.  Order a size smaller!  Don't be like me and think ""oh, I like a loose fit.""  These are not loose in your normal size: they are too big!  But order a smaller size and the pants themselves are satisfactory."
4.0,"A little bit long I needed some comfy sweats for lounging and sleeping in, so I gave these a shot! I‚Äôm glad I did.  I love the feel of the Hanes EcoSmart collection‚ÄîI have 3 of their sweaters. They‚Äôre not too warm and they‚Äôre nice and soft inside. Only reason I deducted a star is because the pants were somewhat long on me. Not too long to wear, but a little longer than I‚Äôd hoped."
4.0,"Nice pants, but ill fitting. These pants were snug in the thigh and calf. The waist and length were fine. I ordered a size smaller than normal, as suggested in the reviews. I returned the pants."
4.0,Pleasantly surprised how thick the fabric is The size runs bigger than I was expecting. I think that is why the length is too long for me because they are falling off my waist
4.0,"Wanted to love I really liked these, but they were too large so have to send back."
4.0,"Runs a bit large If you think you were a large measure first.  These ran large and I had to purchase other in a smaller size.  Great colors, doesn't shrink, discolor or pill."
4.0,"Good buy for the price. I am 5,5‚Äù 174lbs with a middle age pouchy stomach.  I ordered a Large.  The material is soft and cosy.  An XL would have been to big.My current measurements are waist 39‚Äù, hips 41‚Äù.  There is still plenty if room in waist.  Length is good.  Did not shrink when washed."
4.0,"Run large I usually get a medium in sweat pants. 5‚Äô4‚Äù 140. I ordered a small and a medium just to make sure. The small is a much better fit. I‚Äôll probably run the medium through a hot dryer to shrink them. I wear them for yard work and walks so just looking for comfort. For the price, great buy!"
4.0,Order 2 sizes smaller. Make sure you order 2 sizes smaller than you normally would wear. I ordered one size down bc I wanted it a lil loose and if I put on a few lbs. Especially that time of month. If I lose weight they'll definitely slide off. Lol. After you try them on and decide to keep wash them. Some reason Hanes smells chemically and is stiff. Once I washed it they were fine. I live in them now. Will prob order another one size down from this.
4.0,Very comfortable soft and cozy sweatpants Very comfortable sweatpants as always with this brand. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô tall 125 pounds and  I ordered a small and they‚Äôre a bit lose in the legs and bum as I have very small legs and no bum to start with üòÇ The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is that after one wash one pair had a hole in the bum. Looked like the seam gave. Never had that happen before. I‚Äôm going to try to fix them myself and if it doesn‚Äôt work out I‚Äôll pitch them. Not worth the trouble to exchange for only $8. All in all very soft very comfortable sweatpants. Will definitely purchase again.
4.0,"Petite sizes are extra short! I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äù and borderline between petite and regular pants. The petite size S seemed fine until washed, then turned into floods even on a shorty like me.  So unless you are extra-petite, or want to show off your gorgeous ankles, then avoid petite and go with the regular length."
4.0,"Fleece pants Wearing, but a little large. I like them roomy."
4.0,Fits larger than your size and you should have long legs I asked for petit large- I did not know they ran a size larger than large and petit means shorter leg in mall stores but petit has no meaning here. I hemmed them three inches. For the price and not wearing them outside makes them ok as I‚Äôm in Covid Isolation anyway.
4.0,"but I found that it fit like other XL Hanes sweats I've bought at Target and ... Other reviews said this ran large, but I found that it fit like other XL Hanes sweats I've bought at Target and the material is fine.  It's hard to complain about a middle rise when that's what you've ordered so I won't.  I will say that I prefer the full-rise, as when I bend over the mid-rise goes too low in the back.  Plus from the middle to the crotch seam feels a bit tight.  I carry my weight in my tummy, so that probably has something to do w/ it as well.  If there's a waist rise vs. middle rise I'd probably order that in the future.  I think the ones I've bought at target are more waist rise and are a tad more comfortable."
4.0,"Better material, I would pay more money for them, a little more more stretch would be nice too... Lounging around the house, I think they were a bit snug in the stomach and crotch area when I bent down I had to keep pulling them up, and they are already pilling in the crotch area, material is to thin...won‚Äôt buy again, I guess you get what you pay for!"
4.0,"Waist is on the larger size These are comfortable pants. Only thing I noticed is I ordered medium, which usually fits me, and the waistband seems looks, not a lot of elasticity to it either. Luckily I mostly got these for lounging around my apt when it is cold."
4.0,"4 stars I have to say 4 stars, I bought a 2X when I'm normally a XL because I am pregnant and wanted room to grow, but it was still really big! Could have gone with a XL and still had room to grow. The pant leg was also pretty long, I walk on them. But you also get what you pay for, for the price, they are comfortable and mostly fit. So cant really complain."
4.0,Wide legs at ankles. I like them other than they are pretty wide at bottom of legs.  Easy to fix as I will just take them in and cut off excess as they were so inexpensive and they are for use around the house since it has been so cold! Good quality and washed well.
4.0,"Nice pants I like these pants a lot. I‚Äôm tall, so I was skeptical anout the length. When I first wore them, they were almost perfect, just a tad shorter than I like. Unfortunately after washing them, they did shrink and now are even shorter. Nevertheless, they are great if you‚Äôre not too tall (I‚Äôm 5‚Äô10‚Äù)"
4.0,"Nice sweatpants for the money. The pants fit great and seem good quality. They were a little thinner than I thought so not warm for Minnesota weather if you will be out side any length of time, but again for the cost they are worth it. I wear them in the house when it's chilly outside and I just want to lounge around."
4.0,"Great deal for the price! These are comfortable and ok to wear for a quick run to the grocery store. They are nice and warm, too.  I didn‚Äôt give it 5stars because it needs pockets to be perfect.But I like them enough to have bought three pairs. Very good deal for the price. üëçüèº"
4.0,Runs large The length is ok waist and hip too large
4.0,"NO POCKETS! Buy them anyway Softest sweats ever! Thin. Warm. Great for inside, not the best for going outside to keep you warm for much longer then going in and out of a store to your car. Don't take a walk if it's cold outside. Very long for me. NO POCKETS!!! That's the worst thing about them."
4.0,"Did not run big for me After reading several reviews that said these pants ran big and to order a size smaller, I did.  For me, they did not run big.  The smaller size was too tight.  I returned them and ordered my normal size and they fit perfectly."
4.0,Soft pants The description is very accurate. Pants are soft and loose in a good way.
4.0,"Great sweats and company I have gained weight due to lack of exercise bc of injured back and other reasons/excuses, but these pants and their support bra cami are awesome.The material is good, not thin and cheap.  For the most part, I love these.  Just won't fit in for dress up. LolüòÇüòâ"
4.0,"Nice pants, but they run large. Overall, I like these sweats.  The color is as described, and they are comfortable.  They run very large, however, so you can either order a size smaller, or if that isn't available, do what I do which is fold the waist over once.  I'd buy them again in another color and I just might."
4.0,Sizing runs big I ordered small for my sister and they were still too big!
4.0,very comfortable I love these I buy them about ever 2 years. They wear and wash excellent . I get home from work and off work clothes go ..my Hanes go on. update.. I still buy these! I am retired now and these I wear a lot. Of course nothing last forever but mine have gone  a long way. I do everything in them.update..these ones I bought were not the best made batch. the waist was cut way to big it was about 3 inches to big! they also were not as soft as I am used too but kept them. the ones I just bought this last week are wonderful! fit well and are very soft. so it depends on maker.
4.0,"Decent sweatpants for price The material is not too thin or too thick. Overall OK quality for the price. Other reviewers have said these run large. I normally wear a large so I ordered a medium which fits perfectly. The only complaint I have is that I have worn (and washed) these sweatpants four times now, and the fabric is starting to pill on the outside, especially in the crotch and butt."
4.0,Hip risers I wish they would make these in high rise to  above the belly button. Run a little large. but after first washing and machine dry they did shrink a little. Longer then i need 31 in. better if 29 in. had not petite . Great buy for the price.
4.0,"Runs large but soft and lightweight I am usually a medium, but I read the reviews and ordered a small. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äù 120-125lbs with wider hips and the small is still a bit loose (and very long). Not enough to make me return them though. They‚Äôre lightweight and comfortable. Just order smaller than you‚Äôd think."
4.0,"A bit too big I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3 so all pants run a little long on me, these definitely did so I had to roll the waist band for them to stop at my ankle bones. The waist band is way too big, with no adjustable waist band. I have an athletic build so maybe someone with a little more curve to them will fit in them better."
4.0,Baggy but okay Order smaller than you normally would!
4.0,"This fits one size too large Buy one size smaller than you would usually buy. I am a large, the medium fit perfectly. If you buy this in your normal size it will be too big for you!*update*I took a star off because it hasn't even been a month yet and I noticed one pair has pilling along the inner thighs from my ""chub rub""... unfortunately I don't think they'll last long..."
4.0,"Small is closer to a size 6 I'm 5'7"", 115 lbs and generally wear a small or medium in sweats depending on the fit. I ordered the small in ebony and it fit more like a size 6 than a 4. If there was a drawstring I would be able to wear them, but they are slightly too loose on the waist for me. Will probably give them to my mom."
4.0,"Experience is meh I like them but wish that they were made better. I checked my washer and dryer and confirmed that they have yet to grow teeth, as after 1 wearing I have a hole in the crotch. Useful, I suppose, were I a stripper, but as I'm not, I'm left with unfulfilled expectations."
4.0,"Nice sweatpants I wear a size 8 in pants and ordered a medium and they fit perfectly. I do wish they were an inch or two longer, though. I‚Äôm about 5‚Äô6‚Äù and they barely skim the top of my foot. I‚Äôm just wearing them around the house so it‚Äôs not a big deal. Very comfortable and great price."
4.0,"I love these sweatpants These are great!  This is my second pair , the last one was purchased about 3 years ago and the quality is great and they are long lasting. This new pair is longer than the last ones by 2 inches so if you are average size they will be perfect. I am 5' 3"" and they touch the ground but I would rather they are to long than to short."
4.0,Excellent buy They run a bit large but I like that in sweats. Tiny bit long but nothing that bothers.  I suspect when they are washed it will all b perfect.  Planning to go online & buy more.
4.0,"Best Social Distancing Pants for $7.50 Seriously, I ordered these pants since I would be spending so much time at home, while social distancing. I am 5ft 8, 140 lbs. and usually wear a dress size 4 and a pants size 6. I ordered a size Small, and they are a little large, but seeing as an extra small is not an option I will go with it. I think they are so comfortable I ordered a second pair."
4.0,"Nice pants but run big. Went by waist size when ordering but pants are too big.  For the price didn't return them, just ordered a smaller size.  Wearing the big ones around the house .  Nice material.  Just about to transition to a size 14 jean and have been wearing a large in men's sweat pants (which are huge now) and wasn't sure what to get in women's sizing.  Got an XXL first, hoping the XL works for me."
4.0,They're good to keep u warm Nothing
4.0,Does not have pockets Just house sweats;comfortable but need pockets
4.0,"Nice light, white sweatpants They are just light sweatpants.  The fit is a little snugger than sweats usually are but with a little longer or baggy top or sweater they will be fine."
4.0,"Open leg, warm, not stretchy but runs big They‚Äôre sweat pants so .. love open bottom, warm, not stretchy but do run big 4sho, got good price definitely worth getting a few pair for the price quality & I won‚Äôt lie the fact that since they run big I‚Äôm a smaller size üòÑ"
4.0,"Great/COMFORTABLE/Runs large Nice, soft sweat pants although thesizing seemed bigger than normal.  I wear a size medium but it was hangingon me.....way too big.  Otherwise. GREAT comfortable sweat pants!!!"
4.0,Comfy for around the house These fit a bit big so should have ordered a size smaller but I got them for just hanging around the house with no intentions of wearing them out - really good value and will reorder another pair but for sure a size smaller!!
4.0,"Just what I need These sweats are a little large ,but after washing they fit like I want . I'm having knee surgery ang I wanted something that will fit loosely and these fit the bill perfectly. . If you're looking for something to make you look sexy ,these are not for you ,but if you are going for comfort they are great."
4.0,"Made by Omar the TENTMAKER..maybe intended Liked the color, Pants must be made by Omar the Tentmaker with giraffe legs! Gracious! Had to cut them off and hem them! Not thrilled about that, but once done thue‚Äôre ok. But when they say WIDE legs..it‚Äôs true...they ARE WIDE!"
4.0,"Comfy Pants These pants are really comfortable.  They do loosen up a bit after wearing them for a while.  I'm glad I read the reviews before I purchased because it is suggested to order a size smaller than you would normally wear because they run large.  Since I ordered one size smaller, they fit perfectly.  Great price for the item!"
4.0,"Heed the reviews, NOT the size chart! After reading that the pants tend to ""run large"", I carefully took my measurements with a tape measure and compared my numbers to the available size chart. I bought a Medium (I wear Size 8-10). Although every one of my measurements exceeded Size S on the chart, that's the size I should have purchased. I altered the pants so they fit.The pants are of good quality for the price, just mislabeled as to size."
4.0,"Nice pants but run large I‚Äôm 5,5‚Äù, 175 lbs. I chose the size large.  The hips were lose and legs were very wide.  I needed a Medium.  If you don‚Äôt have fat legs I would chose a medium.  The material is nice and warm."
4.0,BUY ONE SIZE DOWN BUT COMFORTABLE I read the reviews and was confident it would fit size XL.. WAIST LINE IS TOOO LOOSE!! Why no draw string?!! IT NEEDS A DRAW STRING!!  But I‚Äôm keeping and just gonna add my own elastic. Buy the pants one size down to fit waist line.
4.0,Needs tighter waist Very good fit except the waist could be a little snugger so that I don‚Äôt have to hide them up every time I stand up. Not having a drawstring to tighten does make a difference.
4.0,Comfy but too big Soft and comfortable.  I ordered a small as reviews stated runs big/loose.  I am 5‚Äô5‚Äù 122lbs.  Too big in waist but I just fold the waistband.  I purchased these for just around the house wear so I don‚Äôt mind the extra room.
4.0,"Sizing Comfy and pretty.  It runs a tad big.  I wish there was an extra small available because it's more a 6 than a 4 using number sizing.  If you're a true 4 like I am it's going to be a little baggy, otherwise it's a very comfy pant."
4.0,"Not too thick or thin for Texas winters! The length was good. Not too thick, not too thin for  Texas winters. The waist was too loose. I‚Äôve lost weight but didn‚Äôt accommodate for that, so I got my regular size. I‚Äôm giving these to my sister & I‚Äôm ordering another pair one size down."
4.0,"Comfortable These are very comfortable. They fit the person who is 5, 5"", 240 pounds, carries weight in tummy and booty... long in the leg, fit nicely in the tummy/booty area. No pockets, so be prepared for that. They have not been washed yet."
4.0,"Great value These certainly do run on the larger side and there is a bit of pilling between the thighs after two wears but overall great lounge sweat pants for the cost and would purchase another pair. I am 5'4"", 175lb, ordered a large."
4.0,"I am happy with this purchase. I bought a size smaller than usual & they fit great. They didn't shrink in laundry. They do pill a bit, but I have one of those battery operated clothes shavers to  take care of that. I am overall quite happy with these pants and have ordered a total of 4 prs"
4.0,"MADE VERY LONG Nice pants for hanging around the house but they are way too long - I actually just cut them off with a pair of pinking sheers because I was too lazy to hem them.  Tripping hazard if not - I'm a little taller than average, 5/6"""
4.0,pants are comfy and warm the color is really a nice blue. considering the price these pants are a great deal.
4.0,"Inconsistent sizing Super comfy, great price, but finding the right size has been a challenge.  I'm 5'7"" and wear a size 6, so I ordered these in blue in medium and small, and the mediums were a bit big and the smalls a bit snug, but after washing the mediums they shrunk enough to be a good fit.  Then I ordered a gray pair in medium and they were huge--after washing, they're still 3.5 INCHES bigger around the waist than the blue mediums.  So I'm giving those away and ordering two more pairs, again in small and medium, and we'll just see what fits this time.  Thank goodness for the free returns."
4.0,"Okay if you have a small to average posterior These were long enough (I'm 5'10"") and a Large cleared my hips and thighs (205 lbs, 16/18) although without a lot of room to spare. The fabric is thinner than I hoped for, but should do. I was a bit surprised to realize that they're bootcut, but that's not a big deal. However, they are not cut to fit a badonkadonk. If you have a tush, you're probably fine. I, however, have a badonkadonk, and because of that the waistline drops embarrassingly far in the back. Given what I paid for them, I'm not going to bother returning and just won't wear them outside of the house."
4.0,Size down I wish the waist had a drastring or was my ore elastic the pants are tight in the thighs and loose in the waist. I got a medium because other reviews said to size down. I wear an 8/10 in jeans and usually buy large in bottoms.
4.0,"Very comfy I love these. They are so comfortable, the waist band doesn‚Äôt pinch, the weight is just right. I would give 5 stars if they had pockets. I recommend ordering a size below your normal as they do run a little big"
4.0,Very comfortable Nice fit and comfortable. Nice size pockets.
4.0,Great sweatpants These are cozy and well-made. I'd order a size smaller than you typically wear. There isn't a drawstring at the waist and the elastic isn't super strong so you might find yourself constantly pulling them up if you get the size you normally wear. They run a little big.
4.0,"Item runs larger than chart recommendation. When I ordered these I ordered a size large per the chart but when I got them they were too large. I won't return them because, even though I have Prime, it took over 2 weeks to get them. Other than incorrect sizing, the quality is very good."
4.0,"Small is much too big I wish there was an x-small.. I was so excited when I saw these the price was great and fabric seemed soft too, but they were much too big... Customer service was great though !!!!! No problem returning that's why I gave 4 stars..."
4.0,These are a terrific bargain I liked the thickness. They were easy to take in to a size smaller with my sewing machine. I loved the colors. The washed perfectly.  I called my sil & told her how great for the price & quality they are!! I bought 5 pr.
4.0,"Sooo Big! These sweats are nice ‚Äì soft and comfy. But definitely order a smaller size. I usually take a large, sometimes an extra large. I ordered a medium, and they're about to fall off! Same goes for length ‚Äì they are definitely not petites. They might be talls."
4.0,It is just right for pre winter chill The texture is not too thick not too thin.  It was a few inches too. long as I am 5' 1'
4.0,"Follow the advice to order smaller I live in pants like these for hanging in the house, walking the dog, etc.These will be perfect for Fall.I followed the advice & ordered smaller than I usually would.  I prefer a comfy, not snug, fit.I'm 5'8 and if these were any shorter I would not have liked then."
4.0,Shrunk They shrunk after washing
4.0,"Nice leisure pants w a bit more warmth These pants were a bit big. Probably should have ordered a medium, but I was able to fix them. They are soft and comfy and give a bit more warmth for Winter wear.  The price was great and would order them again."
4.0,"Not bad for $8 sweatpants For $8, this is a decent around the house sweatpants. They do run large, I wear 14/16 and the large is loose enough I feel like I could have gotten a Medium. They are thin so more like around the house, but not outside if its cold."
4.0,Too large Fit to loose.
4.0,"Size down for a comfy fit! These really run crazy large. Heed the other reviews and order down a size. I would usually wear a large in pants and I got a medium, which is still a little loose, but ok. They're definitely very comfortable. I keep trying to reach for a pocket, which these don't have, but they feel like they should. For under $10, I can't complain about anything!"
4.0,Great but very large I‚Äôm usually a size 6 but like my lounge pants a bit more loose so I ordered a medium but they are way too big. For $8 I‚Äôm going to keep them and hope they shrink up a bit in the dryer. I will reorder in size small though cause they are super soft and comfortable. Love the wide leg and the wide waist band
4.0,"Very comfortable This product is very comfortable. I have a petite frame and this is a little too long for me, but I just fold the garter part twice and voila! comfy as heck. I would highly recommend this product. I will be ordering another."
4.0,"Good, but needs a drawstring The pants are comfortable, but I wish they had a drawstring waist. I‚Äôm disproportionate and have to order bigger than my waist size, so the sag a bit. I rolled them, but then that reduces the length. I‚Äôm not totally disappointed and will definitely still wear them."
4.0,"Comfortable, but quite large and hot This are very soft and comfortable. Definitely size down; I'm usually a size XL, but the size L fit fine. I do notice some pilling in the thigh area after one wear, and they're quite warm/don't breathe well. But great for lounging around the house on a lazy day."
4.0,Great I'd like the pants I dislike that they didn't have any pockets
4.0,"Made for tall ladies I'm 5'9"" and these sweat pants are just right for my height.  The waist is not quite tight enough. I wish they had a drawstring to adjust the waist.  I wear a size 12 in pants and I ordered a large.  I will keep these. They are soft and warm."
4.0,"Why do they always make the legs so big on plus sizes? These were really soft and comfortable, but literally no one has legs that big.  I would wear these at home, but not out in public. I don't understand why they think if the waist is big, then you must also have legs twice as big as an elephant's."
4.0,Cozy pants They are a little flared n the leg and lightly fleeced inside such as standard sweat pants.  The wide band at the waist helps with having shirts look neat with the shirt tail left out (no cords).  The length was good.  Great value!
4.0,"If you have an average or high rise, skip these I like these pants, but they fit strangely. They have a very short rise. If you have an average rise or a high-rise, avoid these pants. But if you have a short rise they are a good value."
4.0,"Extremely large Extremely large, I took my measurements and use the chart that was listed I don‚Äôt know if they sent me men‚Äôs pants by accident but they were gigantic very nice quality so I gave them to my roommate who was very happy to have them"
4.0,"Comfy I've owned these for a little over a year. Very comfortable. Runs a little narrow in the hips, so if you're really curvy size up. I'm a size 16, but without much booty, so a large fits me OK."
4.0,"Comfortable, roomy fit. Bought these for my daughter to wear while recovering from foot surgery.  Comfortable, soft, easy to put on over foot cast.  Perfect for what we needed it for.  Would be great to have pockets."
4.0,Nice looking I ordered a small ( only 100 lbs ) & they‚Äôre big on me. Hoping to shrink in dryer. Nice quality. Will keep & take in a bit. Nice enough to wear out & about. ( got in black )
4.0,"Perfect My mother lives them. She is only 4'10"" so they are a bit long for her. She has to cuff them. Other than that they fit great and they wash and dry well."
4.0,These run big I ordered a 2 X. (5'7 230) I normally wear a size 18 for pants.  I tried them on and they were gigantic! I would have fit into a large. They run very big. Size down
4.0,Runs slightly big After reading other reviews I ordered a size down and I am glad I did. I am 5'8 and around 175 pounds. I usually go for a large when it comes to pants but the medium fit me perfect when it came to these sweat pants. I found that the color was really nice and vibrant and they were overall quite comfortable.
4.0,"You won‚Äôt be sorry you bought these pants. Very comfortable pants for Covid times!  I bought 3 pair & love them for around the house, for walks, and sometimes to the grocery store.  Size down. Very little shrinkage.  Great value for the price."
4.0,Very comfortable pants. The pants are very comfortable but they were long.  I understand this may be due to the fact that I‚Äôm short
4.0,"Medium is really a LARGE! I really like these pants. They're warm, but lightweight. Unfortunately, the medium size I ordered was way too big; the waist was too wide and the leg was too long. I liked them enough to buy a small size and although I wear a size 10 and weigh 135 lbs. I found the small to fit very well, though perhaps a little low in the waist, but that doesn't matter."
4.0,"Nice pants! I really like the color (I got the blue ones) and the feel. The lowest size is a small. I got the small, but they are a little big for me. Other than that, I really like the pants!"
4.0,Too Large I always wear a large to be comfortable in my sweats. But these literally fell off. They are still light weight and comfortable. So I'll be using them as a christmas gift so someone else may enjoy them! But size down!!! Seriously!
4.0,"Believe the Sizing Chart I wanted to love these. I almost did love these. I am 5'7"", 135 lbs, and the medium was too big. I considered keeping them anyway, but they were so big that they were sliding off once I started walking. Might rebuy in a small."
4.0,PURCHASED FOR MY SISTER THE PANTS LOOKED VERY NICE.  NICE FABRIC.  I BOUGHT THESE FOR MY SISTER BUT HAD TO RETURN THEMBECAUSE SHE PREFERS PANTS WITH POCKETS.  MUST HAVE A PLACE FOR THOSE TISSUES!
4.0,"Warm Open bottom sweat pants. These pants fits so well and suit my need so well that I have ordered five pair in different colors.  I am 5 foot five, the pants fall at my ankle And are a perfect weight for winters in the north west."
4.0,"Great quality and fit for the price! I simply loved these pants, it is a great bargain and the fit was perfect. I am a size medium and couldn't have fit me any better. The quality and wear are great. I will order them again in more colors."
4.0,waist too big Theyre really cute but the waist was way too big and I got a small... It'll probably be okay once I fix it up though
4.0,Perfect for the price For the price these are perfect. They fit nicely and are cool enough for a light night and warm enough when it‚Äôs cold out. Only downside is no pockets but not a dealbreaker
4.0,"SMALL SIZE IS LARGE Bought these for my wife who is 5' tall and weighs 75lbs. Ordered the small size. These are almost big enough in the waist to fit me. I am 5'11"" and weigh 174lbs. When you get these, wash them as they shed really bad. Left pieces of lint in my washer and clogged the filter in the dryer."
4.0,No pockets The pants work out fine.  I wanted them for more warmth when taking my morning walks.  The reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because they have no pockets.  Pockets are needed for tissues and phone.
4.0,"Great cut, perfect thickness, but get two sizes smaller than Amazon's size chart would indicate. These have a great cut that's quite flattering (as flattering as sweat pants can be, anyway).  I love the open bottom and the extra inseam length is hard to find so it's fantastic these are so long.  However, as many others have said, they run very large.  By Amazon's size chart a medium should fit me, but the small is so big I almost can't wear it without it falling off.  But they are soft and feel nice, and have just the right amount of thickness.  Overall I'm quite happy with these and plan to order more."
4.0,A little lose Thick material and comfortable
4.0,"Surprised at value for money I did not expect much for the price but I am very happy with the product. The legs are a bit wide, which a lot of people would not like, but I like the width. Overall I think it was a good purchase."
4.0,I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4 made for taller people Too long had to roll them up to avoid tripping on them.
4.0,To big and bulky and way to long. way to long and legs to big
4.0,"Runs large! I had to exchanged a medium for a small. They do run large! I'm a women's size 8-10 & 5'5. A small is still a bit loose,but super comfy! I like them a lot. Would love if there were front pockets! For the price and comfort,they're a great find. I wear an ankle brace and dislike sweats with elastic on bottoms,so the open leg is great! May get more!"
4.0,Decent for price Too big but good quality for price
4.0,"Great pants just do down a size Good price and quality but I do highly suggest to go down a size because the pants run big , I ordered a medium and it was way too big should have ordered a small."
4.0,"Runs big I like the fabric very soft and comfortable but it runs to big ,  I ordered small and it‚Äôs huge,(looks like a large to me) by the way I‚Äôm 5 feet and 144 pounds. Too bad they don‚Äôt have xtra small ."
4.0,"fit I like the color, gray and the material (weight). I ordered a XXL and they are very big on me. I kept them because I just got out of the hospital and needed sweatpants."
4.0,"Great deal for the money A little big which is great, not very thick which is great for me I‚Äôve washed them and have not noticed any shrinking which was a great surprise.  I didn‚Äôt notice there are no pockets when I ordered them"
4.0,"Not fitted enough I had already tried on a Medium using Prime Wardrobe, and that was definitely too large, so I ordered a small. After wearing it for a few days, I've gotten used to the little bit of looseness; however, they still reach the floor, so it's not a great feeling when it's raining and the bottom edges become damp easily.At least they're still comfortable to lounge around in the house."
4.0,These run really big My hubby is 6ft 220 and these were too big for him . Huge in the waste not draw string . They would be great if they didn‚Äôt run so big
4.0,Well made and reasonably priced... My wife is in an Adult Family Home and she needed something that was comfortable and easy to get on and off - just what we were looking for...
4.0,"Fit Nice material. My wife is in a care facility. Needed larger pants, but these do not have a draw string so big is big."
4.0,"Warm and soft but fits really large. These are warm and soft, however, they run way large. I tried to shrink them but they are still too large and without a drawstring to help. You might consider ordering one size smaller. Decent for the money."
4.0,Comfy !  Not tight I was so excited to get some plain sweat pants and these are nice but because I wear a big size the legs are also big and I dont like how it looks at the ankle.
4.0,"Not Petite as described Pants are NOT  ""petite"" as in short length even though they are described this way. They are average length."
4.0,"Great pants The pants are great.  I ordered the wrong size but that is my goofiness.  Apparently, I do not know how to use a measuring tape.  They were out of stock at first.  I thought it would be next year before they came.  I was wrong.  They got here in record time less than a week after order was placed."
4.0,"Can you say quarantine pants?!!! ‚ù§Ô∏è I love love these pants! I followed directions and ordered a size smaller than I should, so they fit perfectly.The grey ones I ordered however, have holes in all the seems. In the crotch, a few up each side of the legs. I think if they got that figured out they would be perfect."
4.0,"Sizing is not true to size Great quality, great comfort level. Sizing is off. Even pulling the pants up past my belly button they were too long. I wear a Medium. These fit more like a XL. I recommend going one size down."
4.0,"to large These pants are soft and made well,, I am 5.7 135 pounds I ordered a medium the length was good, but they was to big everywhere else to the point of falling off.  I ordered a small and they fit much better."
4.0,"They do indeed run large I bought a large, and could have easily gone down a size, but if I had done that, they may have been too short.  You can't really beat them for the price.  I'll probably buy more, and try a medium next time!"
4.0,super comfy but not fashionable Definitely run large so order a size smaller than normal. Also don't buy for the fashion but for the comfort. I bought to be comfy around the house but I won't wear them out.
4.0,"Wow.  Big.  Really really BIG. Approx size 12-14 but like pants like these loose for exercise or sleep.  These are REALLY REALLY huge.  Well made, and nice and fuzzy inside.  Will be too warm for exercise."
4.0,Runs large Pants are fine and warm but DO run large as many others stated.  I am typically an 8-10 or M/L and got a small and they are still a little big but wearable.
4.0,"Shorts and a face mask..... I cut the legs @14‚Äù inseam, have a comfy pair of lounge shorts for AZ summer and can make at least 4 face masks or just use the leg, fits a little tight over head but great coverage.... They do seem to run big, but with rolling the top fits fine! Would buy again!!!!!"
4.0,"Comfy Gave 4/5 because no pair of pants is complete without pockets! Otherwise comfortable, and I like the length. It‚Äôs hard to find sweatpants that are long enough to cover my ankles."
4.0,Very good quality but sizing is off. I ordered a medium and they fit like an extra large. I should have ordered a small. I washed them in really hot water thinking they would shrink. But they didnt. That could be a good thing for some people
4.0,"Comfy, good length! These pants fit OK, the waist was a little bit loose and a little bit of a tight fit right around the butt, but that‚Äôs because of how I‚Äôm built. Not the pants fault. They are comfy and a good length, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7‚Äù. It‚Äôs hard for me to find pants that fit correctly."
4.0,"Size runs big It recommended me to get a medium size but I got a large, it does run a few size big but I like it, it‚Äôs warm and comfy, a perfect pants to wear while working from home"
4.0,"Hanes comfy sweats These sweats are great. They are comfortable, a good length for me (31.5‚Äù inseam). Only thing missing are pockets. Good for lounging around the house; doing housework; running errands. I want every color!"
4.0,"Comfortable. As per previous reviews these pants are looser in the waist, but that is what I was looking for.  I just wish it had pockets.  They are very comfortable, washed well."
4.0,"Nice sweatpants and good price, but be aware that they are rather heavy/thick, not lightweight Thicker than I wanted, not really flattering.  But fine for most people, I would think.  The fit seemed correct for the size."
4.0,"Comfy! Very comfy, although they're a little long and a bit on the big side. Next time, I‚Äôll order one size smaller. Other than that, they‚Äôre really comfortable and have a little shape to them, so they‚Äôre more flattering  than regular sweatpants."
4.0,"Great value with comfort Pants are comfortable, fit nicely, are the right length, are substantial (not flimsy), and are a good neutral color. Just what I wanted for casual, informal wear. Lastly, for the price, they are very well made and look like they'll last."
4.0,"super large, but soft and well-made These pants are gigantic for a size small.  If small is that big, they should have the option for x-small.  They did shrink enough with washing that I will keep them.  They are soft and cozy and good for hanging out or a walk, but definitely large."
4.0,"Nice , comfy but big Nice. But like the other reviews, these do run Big. I kept them because I can sew them, which is easier than returning them. They are soft and comfortable, just big."
4.0,Warm but large! These pants are really big. I normally wear a M or L in sweats. These are a size M and really too big to wear out anywhere. Will be ok for home. Very warm!
4.0,"Good value I bought two pair and machine washed and machine dried them.  They fit fine, but I'll need to either hem them or run elastic through the bottom.  That's okay.  I'm 5'4"" and used to that issue."
4.0,"Buena calidad, precio. Talla excesiva. La tela y la calidad son muy buenas, el pantal√≥n tiene un suave forro polar muy agradable. El problema es la talla, le compr√© a mi mam√° el tama√±o L pero luego de la experiencia y haciendo las mediciones conclu√≠mos que para este pantal√≥n, su tama√±o correcto ser√≠a P."
4.0,Nice comfortable pants These pants fit just below my waist and stay up but tend to be on the large side even though I knew that when I bought them.  For the price they are perfect.
4.0,"Fit IS NOT on the large size if you have a butt If you have any butt at all, these do not run small. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6 180 and the larges are tight on my butt and thighs. Fit fine at the hips and waist."
4.0,"Leg length too long While advertised as petite the leg length is about 1.5"" too long. Hope there will be some shrinkage upon washing."
4.0,"Bang for the buck. These pants are soft, comfy and fit well. The purpose of the purchase was for wear around the house but are great for walking around the neighborhood as well. Would purchase again."
4.0,"Made Pants are well made, but I did not notice I had ordered a petite until I had worn the a few minutes, so too short in the ""pants"" part. I would reorder if available in average."
4.0,Good Oportunity Really good price and quality.Size runs a little big. I bought size M and had to change it to a Smaller one (S); but also the S is loose. Im 5'5
4.0,Ran larger Wasn't thinking when got these had just gotten some large timber Wolf pants that were a little tighter than I wanted for lounge pants so I got an extra large pair  they were huge. I think the sizing is more true than most clothing but  they still run a little large to what we normally expect.  they are nice pants I just can't wear these particular ones my bad not the companies
4.0,Runs huge two sizes to big but quality is nice Once I got the right fit...I like itPrice is right might buy again
4.0,Very long Much to long
4.0,"Very big but excellent quality. Quality is great but size down at least 1 size. I got a large, and I can‚Äôt keep them up. My next order will be a medium. I am 5‚Äô4‚Äù and 165."
4.0,"Simple sweatpants No frills no thrills sweatpants.  Exactly what I wanted.  The size was exactly as stated.  Going to buy more as my older ones die off one by one.Update: has to take a star off because I just bought another pair, same size, and it‚Äôs 1/2 size bigger. Don‚Äôt know if I should return and get a smaller size but then what if it‚Äôs too small??  They need to spend a little effort on quality control."
4.0,"great buy! Just needed some comfy sweats for working at home.  Got this in 2 different colors.  Fit great.  Would have gave 5 starts, but I really wish they had pockets!!"
4.0,Women sweatpants with no pockets Im very upset that there too big. I‚Äôd love them more if there were Pockets. Would make them twice as much cuter. Just going to have to reorder.
4.0,Big but cozy I love these. I didnt think i would love basic loose waist sweats. The waist is really loose so they run big there. But its super soft on inside.
4.0,"Comfortable Fit I purchased these sweats for lounging and I'm not disappointed.  I'm 5'4"" and approximately 130lbs and I ordered a medium regular.  Next time I will try the petite because they are long and I have to roll the waistband over.  A BIG plus, they are very soft and comfortable!"
4.0,"They do shrink but run large anyway They were quite large so I washed them and they shrunk a little around the waist, and, unfortunately, quite a bit in length. They are also lower on the waist than I personally like, but they're ok."
4.0,Can't beat the price Was happy to find these pants on super sale they are warm and make a good thermal layer. Only con starting to wear out where my thighs are.
4.0,"Go a size smaller than usual I am 5'7"" and 173Ibs; I went with an XL (my usual pant size). These pants are really comfy and wonderful, but an XL was too big for me. I'm keeping them for lounge wear, but I really wish I'd gotten a smaller size."
4.0,"Comfortable, but too roomy They're comfortable, but I could have gone a size down. I typically wear a large and thankfully these don't have pockets or I'd be having a wardrobe malfunction üò¨"
4.0,They wash nice and are comfy They tend to run quite large and baggy.  I know they are sweats and should be comfy but these have a whole lotta leg room.  They do wash well and are soft
4.0,Comfortable! These are great for sleeping or lounging. They are very soft and comfortable to wear. The color is so pretty. The only thing I don't like is that they are really long.
4.0,Fit Very wide pant.  These pants are best as loose lounge pants not for exercise.  I may have knee replacement so these work for me but even after washing I need to shorten about 2 inches.
4.0,"Comfortable The pants are very comfortable.  I was glad that I had read someone else's review that they run a little large.  I usually buy medium, but bought the small and they are still quite roomy."
4.0,Just a tad bigger than expected but comfortable! Bought an XL for my mom & they fit almost like they would a 2x but not quite that big but overall good quality material. She just says she wishes they had pockets lol
4.0,"These run a bit long, I had to hem up about 2inches. I like the warmth of these pants, and the comfort. They are fine after I hemmed them up about 2 inches. I bought them to wear around the house while cleaning up."
4.0,Not true to size! These pants run very big! Hot my daughter a womens small and she could have worn an xxs. They just fall off of her.
4.0,"Comfy but odd These sweats are really warm and comfy but they are shaped very strangely. I'm glad I ordered one size up because the seat area would have been too tight. The legs are cut very weirdly wide around the ankles and since I'm only 5'3"" the gems have rolled themselves up a little.Tldr: good comfy weird shaped pants for home use"
4.0,"Fleece lining I'm 5.8 and I need to hem pants, it don't come up over butt very well, I'm constant pulling them up over rear end. But they are nice and warm. I do weight 235 lbs"
4.0,"Runs large I got an XL, as I am a size 16 in regular pants. The waist is loose and they are LONG. I'm 5'8"" and they hit the ground when I'm wearing them. I'm okay with it as I got them to wear around the house, but next time I'd order a petite and/or a large."
4.0,"humongous dude it's way too big, i'm usually a medium and i bought a small and it fits 2 sizes bigger... they're comfy tho LOL"
4.0,Very comfortable fit I really like these sweatpants. The only reason I gave a rating of 4 (versus 5) is that they don't have pockets. Otherwise I'd give them a 5!
4.0,Comfortable Fit is good but waist is a little loose. Needs better elastic or drawstring.
4.0,Runs large but are very soft and comfortable Very soft and comfortable. Yes runs very big so order a size down. I usually wear a large so ordered a medium and they fit just right. Length goes below my ankle. Just to the foot but I‚Äôm not tripping. Sits about a inch below my belly button. They are extremely comfortable!
4.0,"Does the job! üòâüëçüèª Soft. Nice. Purchased to wear as pajamas. It does the job. They will probably not last a few years, but it does solve your need for a season."
4.0,"Great price for a decent pant Although it is not a high end feel, it is still soft inside and a nice weight for everyday use. The fit is good for my curvy figure and does not look bulgy or sloppy. For me, the price is right for an around the house sweat that I can also wear to the gym. I don't otherwise leave the house in sweats, but might sneak out to the grocery store in these!"
4.0,Buy a size or two down Super large - had to re-order smaller size.
4.0,too loose I like the feel of them and they are comfortable. The only problem i had was they were to big. They don't run true to size. I got an X-Large and they were very loose on me.
4.0,"Fit is fine,  however the length is very long Warm and fuzzy, what's not to love ‚ù§"
4.0,"def run big - size down Worth the price for lounge pants. 100% size down 1 size though. If you typically wear a S, I wouldn't bother buying because they'll be way too big!"
4.0,Purchased as a gift; no issies Purchased as a gift for senior mother. She liked them and has no complaints. Fit and the material was soft.
4.0,"Fabric not too heavy, not too thin, waist band too tight I've bought several sweatpants for my elderly mother-in-law, they are easy for her to put on by herself. She always takes an extra large but these had a tight waist band compared to others I have for her."
4.0,Legs to wide In large size... Brought this pants because I'm  pre9and needed some comfortable black pants. I'm  5 9 and 160 pounds. The pants fit all the down to the leg. The waist  has an elastic and it's  good for a growing belly.The only con is the pants leg of too wide..Yikes..I ordered  a large maybe I  should have tried a medium..
4.0,"Nice and comfy! These pants have a nice fit, not too baggy.  They are very warm. The only thing I find bothersome is the  lack of pockets."
4.0,"Too large Great sweats, great price.  I bought these for after surgery and they are loose and perfect for recovery.  Just way too big.  Size down."
4.0,"Good, but long leg length I like this product,  but the pants legs were still a little too long. I needed to roll up the bottoms quite a bit so I could wear them without the fabric touching the ground"
4.0,"Runs Large I normally buy medium or large pants and large panties but these medium pants just barely sit on my hips. If they had a drawstring they would be perfect, I may add one myself"
4.0,nice for the money was to large both the black and the pink pair
4.0,"Very comfy and sexy The pants are pretty comfy and the length is just right. The color is very house friendly and it's also very smooth. The pants foot are more like a boot-cut but it's sexy either way. I'm 5ft 7"" and 178 lbs and it fits very well. It was a good buy. Definitely worth the price!"
4.0,Runs bigger Very soft on the inside and very comfy...the ‚Äúelastic‚Äù is looser than expected fits a little bigger than size but it feels good. It goes down when you sit though (at least on me it does).
4.0,Warm and comfy Pants are comfy and fine for hanging around the house. They are not figure/flattering but I didn‚Äôt buy them for that purpose.
4.0,Hanes WOmens' Sweats Good but nto Great That about says it all.
4.0,Really nice cozy pants - order size smaller I was pleased with the cozy fabric and quality of this product but be aware that these pants run large so order size smaller than you wear
4.0,Pant length a little short Pant length a little short
4.0,Baggy pants but comfy Comfy material and great quality. Just big and long in pant length. I usually wear petite size Xlarge pants but these run one size up big. A large would have fit better
4.0,Large and long Nice material but sizing is overly long and large.  I‚Äôm 5‚Äù6‚Äù and ordered a petite size and I am walking on the pants leg. I will have to hem.  Plus the legs are wide.  Looks like bell bottoms. Will be nice with some alterations
4.0,"These are wonderful! The length was absolutely perfect I'm about 5'7"" to 5'8"" tall and struggle to find womens sweatpants that fit both around the waist and in the leg length. These are wonderful! The length was absolutely perfect! Some of the only sweatpants I've ever found that are warm, comfy, and fit. They were a tad big in the waist the first time wearing them but since I always wear shorts under my sweats anyway this was no big deal for me and I assume they will shrink in the dryer too."
4.0,"Definitely order a size down I ordered a size down and it was still a bit big, but it is very comfortable."
4.0,"Comfortable and warm for cooler weather I purchased these a size larger because I've had problems with crotch and waist fit.  Because this is cold weather wear for me, I don't mind them being baggy."
4.0,Runs large Runs at least a size larger than expected.  Appears to be very good quality.  I definitely will return these but will probably order again in a smaller size.
4.0,The material and fit are the most important. I got those Hanes pants for my daughter.She has been sick and needed something soft  to.wear. She loves them.I have bought two pairs for her.
4.0,comfortable I purchased three pair in different colors and really like them.  They don't look like sweatpants.  The only thing I don't like is they pill on inside of thigh.
4.0,Runs big Runs big. And I beg to differ whether it is truly ‚Äúpetite‚Äù but it is comfortable just runs bigger/longer than expected. Also a little higher waisted than I would like for sweatpants.
4.0,"Love these pants, so soft I love these pants but wish they were a little longer.  I hope they don't shrink up much in a cold wash and warm dry."
4.0,"Nice sweats but run large Nice warm sweats but run large. I recommend sizing down 2 sizes. I am normally a Large, ordered a Med and they are still too large. I may order again but if so i will order size small for myself."
4.0,Runs large I really liked it except the small is too big and they didn't have an x-small. Just slides down my hips. I'm going to try the girl's x-large.
4.0,"Super comfy These are super comfy, wide leg.  They seem to run a tad bit large.  I haven't washed them yet so I  don't know if they will shrink."
4.0,I like this brand and order them about every year or so That leg is a bit long will have to take to alterations
4.0,Great casual comfy sweat pants These sweats are very comfy and great for every-day wear.  They fit as expected although they are a little too flared at the ankle.
4.0,Comfortable and a Good Product for the Money Good value and I would purchase again.
4.0,Not too short They are very comfortable and the length is good. They sit above my hips where I like them. A good buy for the money.
4.0,Runs very large I ordered small because it said it ran large. I wear siz 10 clothing and they are big on me. Quality was fine
4.0,Very nice but no pockets Soft warm and comfy. Nice waist band. I do like all pants to have generous pockets. I must have forgotten to make certain these had pockets!
4.0,Very comfortable For the price these pants fit well... the only thing is the pant legs themselves are big.. I don't wear them outside so it does not bother me.
4.0,Perfect for longer legs Very comfortable. I wouldn‚Äôt exactly call them sweatpants. More like lounge pants. But soft material. Fits above the hip. Falls below the ankle. If you have longer legs (unlike me) these would be really cute
4.0,"Long, but quality. I‚Äôm 5ft 3‚Äù 150lbs, and they needed at least an inch removed to prevent dragging on floor. Good fabric, soft though."
4.0,"Bigger fit These pants are made out of a thicker material. They would be perfect for chilly weather, but too warm to wear in the spring/summer. They were comfortable, however, the size small was too long and touched the floor, and the waist was too big."
4.0,"High Quality Fabric The sweatpants are of high quality fabric. However, they seem to run larger than size. I purchased a large and a medium would have been perfect."
4.0,Big Pants! But Super Price! The price of these sweats was great so I can‚Äôt complain too much. But the fit was off by quite a bit. They don‚Äôt shrink much either. (Well of course not when you need them to lol). The material is on the thin side. But still great for wearing around the house. I would buy agin.
4.0,Comfortable fit for my wife These were perfect for my wife to wear around the house and to rehab after surgery. They washed well and are light weight for her comfort level.
4.0,Large and Loose Nice heathered blue color and very soft and warm.  I found the sizing to be very generous but I‚Äôm ok with that as I‚Äôm only wearing them at home.
4.0,Roomy/comfortable Pants length too long.Only negative.
4.0,"My inseam is usually 32, maybe I need 34 I order three pair of pants. I  receive  two pair with no issues. The last pair were scheduled to come Friday.  I didn‚Äôt receive them till Monday. No explanation whatsoever. I‚Äôm ok with my pants; not happy with how the last delivery went."
4.0,Too big in the waist I ordered medium and they were too big. I ordered a small and the waist was still too big but it fit everywhere else.
4.0,"Perfect for the gym I needed a pant to change into at the gym on cold mornings when I swim. These were just what I needed. However, they are very large in the waist. They are low waist but are still too loose. Not a problem for what I‚Äôm using them for but would never use them anything else. Price was right!"
4.0,"warm They are nice and thick material , They fit a little lower on waist line than I like. But for the price no complaints ."
4.0,"Sizes run larger than expected Soft, comfortable. The seat isnt as deep as expected, it runs a little low on my hips.  and it defititely runs larger than the advertised size.  I ordered XL which the size chart said was a 16/18 equivalent. This is closer to a 20 in my opinion."
4.0,love I'm 5'3 145 lbs and originally ordered the large. They were way too big so I returned them for a medium and I love them so much I bought 2 more pairs
4.0,"Perfect, except runs a size above... Usually run a size small but these tend to run a bit too large, I‚Äôd say by at least a size.  Nothing a little roll at the top waist section can‚Äôt fix, although be mindful to ordering a size down from your usual."
4.0,Comfortable These pants are very comfortable; however my usual size (large) is too big. I am not complaining because that is how I like my sweats. Hoping a few washes will shrink them a bit.
4.0,Comfortable and fits well I love the weight of the fabric for this time of year. The only thing I miss is pockets. They‚Äôd be practically perfect if they had pockets.
4.0,I bought this product for a friend I'm pretty sure she's getting good use out of them.
4.0,"Too Long But Otherwise Quite Comfy I am 5‚Äô5,‚Äù  160 lbs and ordered a regular Large.  These pants fit fine through the hips and thighs but are at least 4‚Äù longer than I would have liked and remained so even after being washed.  Though I don‚Äôt normally have to order petite, perhaps that would have worked better for me in this case.  But how is one to know??"
4.0,Good product but size is deceiving Good material but size is deceivingToo loose... not sure if it will shrinkToo much hassle to returnWould gave. Wen nice if I could exchangeFor 1 size smaller

4.0,The length is great. I always order a size large because generally it fits because I wear a size 10 to 12 but these were way too big. I'm going to keep them because they don't fall off me. I'll just wear them around the house for comfort instead of going out like I was planning on.

4.0,"The pants are super comfortable. However The pants are super comfortable.  However, I ordered a small and they are almost falling off my hips, even after two washes.  Definitely order a size or two smaller than you'd usually wear.  I am generally a medium (4-6) pant."

4.0,These are great for the price These pants are warm and comfy and they fit fine. The only minus is that I wish they were a little (just a little) longer. I air dry to keep them from shrinking. The price is a definite plus!

4.0,Things change I've worn these sweat pants for 3 to 4 years now.Ordering new ones in different colors was needed.  Time has changed the thickness and quality of the fabric.Not as thick as they used to be and it does make a difference.
4.0,"comfy I wear a 10 to 12, and ordered a large  these are a little larger than i wanted, legs more flared then I was hoping,  big around the waist but comfy, nice material, so I am enjoying them"
4.0,Nice and comfortable! I ordered three different colors and find them very soft and comfortable. The only draw back is the material pilled after the first wash. I hung them to dry so it it wasn‚Äôt from using a drier
4.0,"Go down a size and be aware it pils I love the price, fit and comfort.  I usually wear large but medium was perfect for knocking during lockdown but not for going out because it pils big time."
4.0,"Good but big Great comfy pants for the price. BUT cut too big. I am an extra large in EVERYTHING I wear. Sometimes I have to buy 2x. Not these pants. I will likely order more, but definitely ordering large next time. Extra large fit, but they are comically loose and I have to pull them up often because they slid down my waist. I bought them to wear around the house so it's no big deal if I look like a clown. And they sure are comfy!"
4.0,"Grandma approved ""slacks""! I got these sweatpants for my 90 year old grandma to wear at her assisted living facility (she calls them ""slacks"" which I find hilarious!). She needs clothes that are comfortable and move with her, don't pinch her fragile skin, and can withstand rough laundry cycles. These pants meet all her requirements.I do think they run large, but after a year of hot washes they have shrunk a bit and yet still fit her fine. I'm glad to have found ""slacks"" that keep her comfortable and tolerate her facility's not-at-all delicate cycle laundry.For reference, she's gained weight since she moved in to assisted living (due to having three solid meals a day and people to share them with). As she has gained weight I have gone up a pant size to make sure she's comfortable.Height 5'5""Weight 114Size: Petite SmallWeight 136Size: Petite Medium"
4.0,"These pants run at least a half size large!  Comfy for casual and slouchy wear! I ordered these in 2X in ebony for $7.50.  This is a very reasonable price.  What I've found is that they quickly stretch out and they are already generously sized to begin with! I just ordered another pair in size XL.  I wouldn't say that they are tailored by any means. They are very casual and the fabric is somewhat thick and will most likely collect lint.  If you want comfy pants for home, running errands or throwing over your tight-fitting gym clothing, these would fit the bill. I'm wearing them with the waist rolled down. They are a bit wide at the ankle for using for exercise classes, plus they'd probably be too warm for indoor fitness."
4.0,"Great pants run 1 size big So Useful in winter I love these sweapants. They don't look too much like sweat pants, especially in charcoal and at least from afar, They are so warm. I wear them around the house in the winter and when it's unbearable outside, I  wear them out to errands as well. The waist is great, wide covered elastic. Without pockets, the hips aren't overly bulky. They don't shrink much if at all.SIZING::: Runs 1 size large. This year, it ran 1.5 sizes too ;large and I measure the ones I got this year to my older ones and the same size was HUGE all over this year...waist elastic and hips...They aren't wearable, what a waste. 3 stars because normally they are great.ADDENDUM TWO YEAR LATERLast year (a year after above) I had gained some weight. That meant I was a solid size large in sweat pants so bought the medium. They fit perfectly. This year, I gained alot of weight, so bought the Large and they fit. As long as you know they run a size big, you are golden with these. That review last year, I must have gotten a pair that was mis-sized. The price is a steal. BE WARM THIS WINTER"
4.0,"Very comfy, no pockets though (#murderino info) Very comfortable, loose at the ankle (no elastic), no drawstring (not an issue, they haven't been falling off), but no pockets. If I had known they had no pockets, I may have reconsidered, but i caught them on a flash dale for, like, six bucks. Let's be real, I would have gotten them anyways, just less of them. But for less than ten bucks, no complaints here."
4.0,"Huge in the legs! Now while these are very soft and warm they are huge in the legs! I buy midrise because then they fit at my waist, and I always buy XL in sweatpants to make sure they are comfortable. I could easily fit two of my legs in each one of these legs. (I could probably make a long skirt out of these!) So If you don't mind floppy large legs, then these are great! I received these as a gift from my wishlist, so will not return them. Comfy around the house but I would not be seen out anywhere the way they look on me."
4.0,Perfect for an old lady Is too lose on the waist for me but it will be perfect for an old lady
4.0,Black ran huge!! This particular sweatpant ran VERY large. I was looking for a comfortable fit and ordered medium. I usaually wear a medium or small. These were enormous and fit like an XL. Ordered in heather gray as well and those fit loose but comfortable. I kept both because it was cold and too much trouble to exchange. No one else seemed to address this as a problem. Just be aware they run from comfy loose to ‚Äú need a rope to keep them up!‚Äù.
4.0,Great pants but SO big! Runs very large. Bought a medium (usual size) and now I think even a small might be too big.
4.0,"Order a size down, people! I'd give them a 5 if they weren't so darn big for a medium!I am 5' 6"", 140 pounds. I purchased size M. The length is perfect though pants are quite loose, after having washed them on Warm/Warm in a machine and dried in a hot dryer. I am going to try size S if I order again.The particular pair of pants I received do have construction flaws, the waist is bunched on one side where the pant front was not properly stretched to fit the waistband. It wouldn't be as noticeable if the pants had a more snug fit, but would still be noticeable. The ebony pair I purchased at the same order did not have such a flaw."

4.0,"Soft but Shrink! I ordered these in a size L based on other reviews. I'm 5'5"", size 14 pants. When I tried them on right out of the package they fit great - very soft, waist band fits well and the length is perfect. I took off 1 star because these shrink and become tighter after washing. After washing they shrunk up about an inch in length and the waist band is now tighter. I'm going to size up next time and account for that. For the price though, you can't go wrong."
4.0,These run very large They appear to be great pants but they are too big.  They did shrink some when I washed them.  I am ordering the small.
4.0,long too pong s/b petit
4.0,Run BIG These are HUGE. size downüëç
4.0,"Run large but are great quality, and very comfy! I think these are definitely great quality. They are very soft and comfortable. These are awesome for lounging around or wearing on a lazy day. They are thick enough to keep me warm but aren't heavy or bulky feeling. I read other reviews saying these run large, and I agree. The length is perfect for me as I am 5' 6"". I ordered a small as it's the smallest size available, and it fit more like a medium or large. I don't mind but do have to roll it up twice at the waistband. I think the price is very reasonable, and would absolutely repurchase!"
4.0,Too big! Too big on the waist.
4.0,"Comfy and look better than typical sweat pants. I'm 5'4"" and usually wear size 6 - 8 (depending on the brand) and ordered the medium and it fits fine.  Nicer looking than most sweatpants. They do stretch out a bit after wearing for awhile, get back to their original shape after washing/drying. My only complaint is that they seem to really attract lint and/or animal fur very easily so I have to use those 'pet hair rollers' often. These are a very good value for the price."
4.0,super comfy. super comfy.. but I have to fold the waist over to wear them because they are so big around the middle. I have hips.. not a gut. When I was them- they shrink a little.. but then relax again and I continue to roll the top over. They are fantastic other than that
4.0,"A bit long... They run somewhat long for me, at 5' 2'. Otherwise I love them!"
4.0,"Long, wide legs Nice material, soft, comfortable.  I am short, so length or the legs is always an issue for me, but the legs are as wide at the ankle as the rest of the leg.  I always have to hem pants, but taking them in width wise is a first."
4.0,I would say they fit good a little snug in the legs I would say they fit good  a little snug in the legs.  I normally wear a x large in sweats so next time I order a pair i am ordering extra-large.  Overall good quality product
4.0,"they fit great. Comfey and soft, they fit great."
4.0,"Four Stars Would have been a good deal, had they fit. I'm 5'10"" so they were too short."
4.0,"Good value For a nicely priced pair of sweats, they are very comfortable and the material is fairly thick.  Would buy again."
4.0,"Runs large I am 5'5"" and 150lbs. I ordered a large and it was gigantic on me, I am returning it for a medium. These sweatpants run big in the waist and also long. This regular size would not fit a petite person whatsoever."
4.0,Four Stars The pants fit just as expected.  I have a few others and was looking to add.
4.0,run large good bargain but hoping they shrink
4.0,Almost perfect They were a little long in the legs for petites but other than that they were just what I expected.
4.0,"Ok for Except for Falling Off Part Photo is after 20 minutes of wear. Better than a lint roller for the carpet. Exceptional static cling. Pet hair jumps from carpet to legs. If you‚Äôre on the fence, black is best option for white dog hair. Amazing contrast.These are not yoga pants. I think they may run big.Am roughly 5‚Äô2‚Äù and 125 pounds.I foolishly ordered a large.Were in stock. Available.So, my bad.They are big on me.ButOoooh!New sweat pants for not going anywhereFelt great!You should know these are humble sweatpants.They are not those slick, smooth, wide band kind of yoga, or whatever, exercise pants.In fact,they are not even warm, cozy sweatpants.Maybe just feel kind of ok because they are new. Not great in the mirror. Shapeless.But, they were not all that expensive so maybe it is understandable they are not exquisite, or anything even next door to exquisite.Yes. Admittedly more homely than anticipated.Ok. The details.Thewaistband on these sweatpants is two inches wide and is ribbed like some sweatshirt necklines.They are a medium thickness with a fuzzy and already pilling into little balls lining.The outside is not not nylon/Not stretchy smooth.The legs are wide, mostly from the knee to the ankle with a wide , finished hem. Long on me. Of course.Oh. And I counted:I have to roll the waistband three times to have them sit on my hips.Then they fall off.I know.  I should have gotten a small.But.I‚Äôm keeping them. Because I wore them for long enough today - that 20 minutes of something new to wear -  that they look pretty gross.Plus they made for kind of a fun day. I bought the ticket, you know?Desperate times :-/"
4.0,"Runs large, very long, bottom of leg also wider than expected. First, very glad I read the reviews - they do run quite large. I ordered a size down and they are still a bit roomy and they are longer than 31"" inseam - more like 33"" on the medium. The bottom of the pant legs are also really wide - much wider than pictured or described. With that said, I will probably keep them as they are super comfy, just be warned as to the sizing issues. I would order more if the pant legs were less wide at the bottom.I ordered a regular, not petite, which I wanted - and saw no mention of Petite in the sizes to choose from or in the product page description. However, on my receipt, which I realized after ordering, it shows up as petite after you order and on the ""your orders"" page no matter what size you order. Luckily, they arrived as regular, not petite. Not sure why they can't correct that on the product page. These are REGULAR, not Petite - and there is no option on the product page to choose petite so."
4.0,"When this site says they run big, they run big! I'm 5'3"" at 120 lbs. I normally wear between a small and a medium. Most things online run small so I go up a size to a medium, knowing they aren't the highest quality they will probably shrink. So at first I bought a medium and they were huge! I returned them and got a small. They run big. They washed up nicely and didn't wrinkle like some material does. I gave them a 4 star rating because the material they are made of seems they will be warm to wear. It cost a fortune to get 100% cotton so I settled for these. The $$ was great!"
4.0,"Nice surprise I needed some comfy pants after having a baby. I was skeptical that a size small would fit my 5'6"" 148lb self, but they do, they fit great. I don't like tight clothing, and after a wash these are slightly snug, but not tight. I think they'll stretch back out as I wear them through the day. Really nice comfy pants."
4.0,"Comfy pants that fit over my walking boot/cast This is my third pair I've ordered. The only drawback is NO POCKETS. I'm off work for three plus months because I had to have two surgeries on my feet/legs. These pants easily fit over my splint/cast/walking boot. They stay up and are not too hot and not too thin. Can't beat the price. I'm 5'9"" and they are plenty long enough for me.  Once I am Mobile again I might take these in and have some eclectic flannel pockets sewn on them so I have a spot to carry my phone."
4.0,"Good $10 sweatpants OK I gave these four stars because they are $10 pants. But remember when you order them they are $10 pants. As other people said they are on the lighter side for material of sweatpants, but I wouldn‚Äôt call them thin. I would order one size down because there‚Äôs no drawstring and they are a little loose. They are pretty loose through the legs too I would say they are almost like wide fit style. Maybe that‚Äôs because I ordered them a size bigger though. My biggest complaint is that they don‚Äôt have pockets, I would buy more if they did.For ten dollars they‚Äôre a great deal. They are perfect for a day at home or running errands."
4.0,"Good warm pants Only drawback - no pockets . Good quality , fits well and perfect length . I take a 31 inseam - I like my ankles covered and they do that . They are soft and warm and have a wider, flat and not restrictive waistband . I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6‚Äù and wear a 12/14 and these pants fit fine"
4.0,"VERY LARGE In spite of other reviewers stating that the item was large, I chose to order my usual size.  The reason:  I thought they would shrink in the dryer.  Well, they did not shrink.  So, I have some VERY comfortable, but long (dragging the floor) pants.  I do have some concern that one pair might slide down, so am not wearing them out of the house.  I may have another go in the dryer at a higher setting."
4.0,"Confortable, fit well, but one pair needed a small repair I got three pairs of the sweatpants because I'm having shoulder surgery and I needed pants I can put on with one hand.  These fit the bill.  I'm 5""7"". 143 lbs and ordered the small.  They fit well in all areas, even after being washed.  One of the three pairs had a small area come unstitched in the crotch after being washed.  Luckily, I sew and will fix that in moments, but I took one star off because of it.  Overall I'm happy with the purchase."
4.0,So soft These are not petite but that‚Äôs ok because I just rolled a little cuff.  I love the softness and most importantly the light weight is perfect.  I really want the light weight because I hate to be hot.  I will be ordering more.  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äù and they are long.  But like I said‚Ä¶. I just rolled a cuff.  I don‚Äôt plan on wearing outside.  I just want to be snuggled up at home
4.0,"Great, but Wash Alone First! Ordered Large, Petite.  5'3"" older gal, 158lbs.Fit great! Feel sturdy, especially for $9.99 saleWASH & DRY ALONE  the first time! Thankful I read other reviews.Washed in warm/cold, Ebony and Heather Grey.  Came out great but, washer was lined with lint, though I only noticed it by running a finger along the washer.Used washer cleaning tabs 1 cycle normal wash with a 2nd rinse.  Came out nice & clean, ready for more laundry.Likewise I dried them together, nothing else, on Medium 30 minutes.  Came out great, no shrinking.Dryer lint screen was full, but dryer drum clean.  Will wash & dry them alone after wearing, expect it will be normal this time.A little one-time effort, but at this price, not a bad trade off."
4.0,"Warm and comfortable I bought these to wear around the house this winter.  I would not wear these in public because they are too short and one leg is slightly shorter than the other.  I am 5'6"". I have see this with this brand before but not with other brands, so it's not my legs.  I will keep this pair because I need them."
4.0,"a little weird fit the material is pretty warm but the fit is a little wonky. It's a low rise and too wide at the hip and short from waist to crotch.  I'm keeping them bc I'm only using them for around the house.  The leg is wide. Someone should re-vamp- this pattern, then they would be a good pair of pants."
4.0,"Good quaity material It seems that the vendor did not label the packages correctly. I ordered regular small and received petite small.I returned the item and purchased another item, again ordered regular small and again received petite small.Since the price was good, I decided to keep petite small and use as P.J.'s since item is short for me, it will keep me warm for winter."
4.0,"good for the price! I knew the waist would be 2 inches too big but I still like them. They aren‚Äôt super thick but they aren‚Äôt thin, good for the price. I got the smallest size and I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt size up because the waist was too big but the length fit. The height and size isn‚Äôt accurate for this item, these are pants I got for someone else who is 5‚Äô3 and around 120 lb"
4.0,"Great and I didn‚Äôt have to leave my house to get them These are great. I was surprised that they fit, but they do, no issues. Material is as expected - maybe better since cost wise they are so cheap. The only negative thing is they don‚Äôt have pockets. But I knew that when I bought them."
